NeverCanTellWithBees Is this sub dead? Dead?
Csauter36 Hello Mods. I sent you a message yesterday, if you wouldn't mind getting back to me that would be great. Helloooo
Csauter36 There is an overwhelming movement in the #walkaway campaign, which has yet to make it's way to our beloved Reddit. This Page will be updated and edited soon to make the transition Stay tuned, #walkaway campaign coming soon
NeverCanTellWithBees We have added new flairs! Pick yours now. Comment below for additional flair ideas.  New Flairs Added
Csauter36    Welcome to the #WalkAway movement. If you are reading this, most likely you are a past liberal fed up with the direction they've been goin,; still a liberal curious about this whole thing; or a conservative that has been witnessing the demise of the left. 
   Whatever your reason, there are a few things you should know
   You don't have to like Trump. You don't have to write MAGA after every comment. You could even despise the man. Unlike many places these days, you don't have to agree with everything just to be accepted.
   We accept all sorts of people coming to us with the same reason: the left no longer aligns with our beliefs or morals. 
   This is a place for us to come together and converse without being ousted or labeled some sort of "-ist" or "-phobic" just because of a willingness to think or discuss. 
   We appreciate all of your making this movement possible, and I truly hope this community helps you find peace and happiness as I know it has for me.
   Much love, new family. Welcome Newcomers. Please read to learn a little about us.
stancrouch Will the democratic party come back to the middle or will a third party need to be created?  What events would have to take place for the party to get back to the middle or slightly left? Prediction Question
KatBlackwell Hello everyone. I've been super fascinated by this movement since I learned about it, because it reflects the subtle shift in ideology I've been having over the past several months. I was never someone who leaned hard left, but I was definitely steeped in progressive culture for a time, and I have meaningful friendships there.

I haven't written on the public Facebook page yet, though, (even though I know that's where the main group is!!), because... well, it's public! I stand to loose some friends, but it would be even worse if I was honest about what I thought on Twitter. I have a notable platform there, including a podcast that's very social-justice-y. (As an aside, I've been emotionally disconnecting from my own podcast lately, and trying to think how to evolve it to better reflect my current worldview.) 

I've seen how my own niche Twitter community, the readers/writers/science-fiction-and-fantasy lovers (which is the target audience of my podcast, and has become overwhelmingly liberal in recent years) has absolutely TORN APART other prominent members in the community when they were even \*suspected\* of falling outside the "approved beliefs/behavior" criteria. Seeing the vitriol in action has made me sick to my stomach with fear of that happening to me, and it's part of what's shifted me in a different direction. This community has been a big part of my life the last 3-4 years, even though I've felt more and more out of place there. Losing what I have there would hurt, *a lot.*

Plus... WELL, they have the power to destroy almost 100&amp;#37; of the current reach of my podcast. I'm trying to monetize the podcast and actually make money from it. And this community could undo all my hard work.

Thank you if you've read this far. I'm just wondering, has anyone here stood to loose similar things by talking publicly about their ideological shifts? If so, how did you handle that? What are ways I can prepare myself in case I get caught up in a social media storm?

**TL;DR** If I talk on Twitter about my no-longer-leftist views, I could lose my standing in a community that's important to me, and have my passion project/potential source of income (a podcast) all but destroyed. How can I prepare myself in case this happens? A newcomer seeking advice
MichaelPortersBack I am new to this movement and wanted to ask. Is it because of Donald Trumps policies or the Democrats ignoring you. Also is everyone in walk away moving to the Republicans? Why are you walking away
byng259 Thanks for adding me to the group admins, and although my story isn’t from the left, or the right. I have walked away from the two party system that Americans as a whole use to label each other.

Background on me, I was born in MD but moved to NC at a young age due to my older brothers school being shot by thugs shooting at each other. We moved to NC in a small town and my father worked his tail off to provide the essentials and almost nothing more. My father was a republican and my stepmother was independent. Politics went unnoticed unless it was a joke in my house, and even then not much was said (this was during the Clinton administration, so many jokes could have been made!). I grew up southern baptist, my parents didn’t go, but my brother, sister, and I went every Sunday morning for 15 years. My father taught me the value of hard work and that you don’t need to apply for assistance to get by. He did try at one point when he lost his job temporarily. When he applied for food stamps he got told that his unemployment was too much and they approved him for only 15 dollars a month. He said forget it. We are a LOT of ramen noodles til he figured it out.
Fast forward to 9-11-01. I was in 7th grade. I remember the day like it was yesterday. Bush’s words resonated with me in a way that a politician never had before. I was young, but knew that something terrible happened to my, no, OUR country by a country that I couldn’t spell or point at on a map. I wanted revenge, I wanted someone to pay for what had just happened. Bush united America for a short time and people were kind, looked out for each other, reported anyone wearing a hijab. Wait, what?!? Yeah... that was my first run in with racism. If you were a Muslim you were the bad guy. If you looked Mexican but didn’t speak Spanish in my town, you were shunned. I thought it was just patriotism, doing my civic duty of eyeballing and keeping an eye on them cause my small town was next. Ugh, to have the ability to take those feelings back...

Fast forward to ‘07, my older brother was in the military and was infantry, I’m enlisting in the infantry and Obama wins. I never called him names, never threaten him, never ask to see his Birth certificate. He was our commander in Chief, I still believed that they would see us all as Americans and look out for us. I saw a huge influx of racism. I thought, how can this be? Our president is black and I’m in the army for goodness sake! I see cities destroyed, police brutality saying that the police were in the wrong, rules of engagement tying our hands in fights in Afghanistan, and unemployed workers struggling to find a job. I realized that he was just doing his parties bidding. I hated the second term, but still, no complaints from me cause he’s the president and to call for his head, in my mind, is a form of treason.

Trump gets the nomination. I am excited. I’m out of the army and going to school, working side jobs at night and A stay at home father during the day. I’ve always known about Trump, but not actually known about his life and his businesses. I just knew he was rich. But now on the News I’m seeing celebrities saying if he wins they are moving (who listens to these people about politics!),how he’s a racist, a crook, in bed with the Russians, and how he has no experience running a country so why should he? The left reached so far for dirt that they found accidental dirt on Hillary. But they claimed that she was a better candidate for our country. She thought she had the women and the minority’s vote. That night, I cried. I was so happy to have someone that was for the people and for Veterans that would clean up the VA system that people have a hard time navigating (not me, I have yet to have a problem, IDK why everyone complains...), to have someone that can create jobs, and to have someone that wasn’t bought by lobbyists that could dangle dollars in his face for him to feel a certain way. I was glad to have common sense. I was glad to have someone that was proud to be an American and that was wanting a better nation for posterity. I am still happy with the election, he is my president, and i want him again in 2020.

I said i am walking away from the two party system though. Let me explain further on that. I don’t want a group of people to say that they have the money and that they support this person so he gets tons of air time. I don’t want someone to owe people something once elected. I don’t want people to not have the option to select the best candidate because these parties didn’t want them in office. If someone has a good idea, let them be heard. If something is broken, fix it. For the love of God if it isn’t broken, don’t try to fix it! I believe in starting from nothing and building something, not having an election given cause it’s the lesser of two evils. If everyone in this country wants to be on the ballot, do it (figuratively, we don’t need a phone book for a ballot!). But this way of having a limited option cause they have more money and they won the popularity contest with people I’ve never met has to be stopped. I want people to have the options to choose again. That’s why i am walking away from the two party system.

Enough of the “you believe in that so you must be this”. I want people to realize that we are all American. I lean more right than left. When people talk to me on sites I have to be a racist cause I like Trump. I must be republican cause I was in the army. I must want all Mexicans out cause i want a wall. I must not be Christian cause some of my friends are homosexual. No. Enough of that garbage. It’s all a divide. I am American. Proud to be. I want everyone in America to be proud of their heritage, but not be mad that someone don’t like their point of view. Okay. I’m ranting now. I hope I made sense. The stories here are amazing, and thanks to everyone that has shared! I’m walking away (pending on FB)
Lurkingnopost This is the day that I, a licensed criminal Al defense attorney eh, was told by crooked Comey that no reasonable prosecutor would have sought an indictment given the mountains of evidence against her. 

It was at that moment that I realized how truly deep and dark and vile our system had become.  Just celebrated my two year walk away anniversary. 05 July 2016. The day that justice died in this nation.....
closer_to_the_flame Hi. Am real American liberal. Have walk away. Is good. 

Walkaway real. Not fake forced meme. Very real. Very american. Go Yankees, win football match!!! I have walk away from American Democrat Party because it is nyet good
IchBinDeinSchild I have made many potato from #walkaway. Leftist tears take my potato away. I have many more vodka from #walkaway. I have made many potato from #walkaway. Leftist tears take my potato away. I have many more vodka from #walkaway.
The-Plauge-Dragon There are several people who think that all of the #walkaway movement is just the work of Russian ‘bots’ (wtf is a ‘bot’ anyways?)!  This means that this movement is a legitimate threat to the far left!  Keep going! This movement is a threat to the Democratic Party!!
TenebrousFinch * They suppress free speech in the name of political correctness.
* They attack the Second Amendment in the name of security.
* They promote racism in the name of equality.
* They allow criminals to invade the border in the name of tolerance.
* They seek to abolish all immigration enforcement in the name of compassion.
* They riot and assault their opponents in the name of peaceful protest.
* They promote socialist policies in the name of fairness.

I once believed that the Left promoted acceptance and kindness. But now I know better. They disguised a *hateful, destructive, insecure, authoritarian ideology* beneath a veneer of compassion and altruism.

I did not gradually discover this over time. *It all occurred to me in a single instant.* When I realized what the Left truly was, I was completely horrified. I did not just walk away from them. *I ran away like my life depended on it.*

When I was left-leaning, I used to feel white-hot anger and insecurity every time I read the news. Every single day. Sometimes I felt that my very life was at risk, like I was under attack. But now I can interpret events in a calm, level-headed way, without being blinded by such negative emotions.

I advise everyone on the Left to walk away from this dangerous ideology before it further harms our nation.  #WalkAway: Why I left the Left
RoxyCupcake I left the Democratic Party because neoliberalism is a cancer. We need a real workers movement in this country so we can seize the means of production and give power back to the people. 

Bombard the headquarters, lads!  Democrats: We're comin', bucko!
Morpho_Pequod I like to think of myself as an iconoclast. #Walkaway: Why I left the Left.
CuckSlayer1984 For the most part, this is reason why I went into the #WalkAway Movement: identity politics, demagoguery, groupthink, binary equivalence, revulsion of law and order, and extreme racism and tribalism are all reasons I left the Democratic Party. They would rather engage in crafting no message except for a revulsion of the opposition party's message and think that is sufficient for voters. I disagree. I had hoped Bernie Sanders would be the change agent to be FDR reborn and push 21st Century New Deal policies and principles but he has since been engulfed by the Alt-Left and their extremist Social Justice Warriors and tribal groupthink so, as I still admire and respect Senator Sanders, I am disheartened that he has been coopted by the far left. Also, I hear the mobs of people and I see them daily who just want more after they put the cart before the horse. I just have only so much sympathy. This was showcased by hearing the throngs of ghetto trash in Yolo County who wanted to overthrow a very capable District Attorney who stood for law and order with a Public Defender to run the District Attorney's office. The same happened in Sacramento County with the mindless knee-jerk reactionaries who were out for blood after the Stephon Clark shooting even though, after toxicology reports showed he had large amounts of drugs in his system which was why he probably didn't comply and the bodycam and helicopter footage showed he was demonstrably evading police and engaging in suspicious activities, proved the police were innocent. I cannot continue to just sit by while a large part of the left just wants to get a free lunch; as we know, that money has to come from somewhere and it's likely out of my wallet which should go to feed my wife and son who I responsibly provide for. To me, this is about personal responsibility and making the right choices. I should not be penalized for making better choices and others should not be rewarded for making the wrong choices. That's what this is about for me. That's why I, and many others, are walking away from the left. Why the Alt-Left forced me to #WalkAway
j3w1 If you haven't seen this, I really think it's a MUST SEE.

Silence_is_Death This place may become another fun part of reddit, I may be on the Trump train but as an ex-Dem myself I look forward to seeing what this place becomes. No sarcasm when I say this; you all have my respect for walking away from the violence and lies that have become a main part of the Democratic party. However if you don't want someone like me here I'll stay on my side of the fence if that is what you wish. Don't let the downvote brigades and trolls get you down, just shows you're getting under their skin and the poor babies are triggered. From an ex-Dem turned MAGA.
RadicalAltCentrist I used to think questioning things was fucked up. That it’s wrong for me to think there’s a possibility that this shit wasn’t true. I must be oppressed. I must be discriminated against. I must be seen as weak.     
    
...but I’m not. I’m fucking not. Conservatives don’t actually hate me! They hate the way I was acting. That blew my mind. I have conservative friends now, and they’re super nice.     
    
I don’t have much to say, I’m not that articulate. I just feel really free and I wanted to share.  Any former SJWs in here? I chose to #WalkAway about a month ago when I decided I should research the other side more. Turns out, the left is an echo-chamber for a reason!
YoThatsRough I hated guns and God and most of all - Republicans. I loved Europe and big government programs and Barack Obama. First I #walkedaway from identity politics...Jordan Peterson helped with that. Next I learned to love this amazing country and renewed my faith in God and my Jewish heritage...Dennis Prager helped with that. Next I learned about why free market Capitalism has been the greatest force for good in human history, and why Socialism is wrong not just economically, but also ends in totalitarianism and mass slaughter...Ben Shaprio and Thomas Sowell helped with that. I love the USA and the constitution and hate the liberal hysteria. 

The way CNN covered the embassy move in Jerusalem and the “innocent slaughter of civilians in Gaza” (even though they were all in Hamas) made me sick to my stomach. They’re painting Hamas terrorists in a positive light? Are you kidding me?? It makes me sad how my fellow Jews are 80% Democrat and put politics before their religion and people. My cousins in Israel didn’t serve their country and mourn their friends killed by Hamas so our leftist media could spit on them. Conservatives support Israel and so I knew that was the place for me. 

I’m so glad I was able to #walkaway  I volunteered for Bernie’s campaign and even saw him speak live...twice. I’m now a conservative.
BlockwartKlaus ![video](5vmb2hja2x811) #WalkAway meme..hope you'll like it!
Throw8away8910 If you vote anything but Democrat come November you're a traitor.

Don't fall for this misinformation campaign. Get out and vote democrat to take our country back from the treasonous administration we now have. If you walk away, you're not a patriot.
traunks Now that I've been properly influenced by the Russian-backed campaign known as #WalkAway, I will be voting GOP from now on. Thank you for finally making my weak ass with no critical thinking skills fall for your bullshit by seeing a bunch of dicks repeating the same shit online.

Join us, other dipshits. Walk away with us. I voted Democrat for 20 years. Not anymore.
EyePharTed Echo.... echo... echo.... nothing? Time to walk away then Echo!
oozles Repeat after me:

**We have not been manipulated by Russian propaganda**

The American free press are liars and not to be trusted

The American Intelligence agencies are liars and are not to be trusted

Trust Russia

Russia is our friend

**We have not been manipulated by Russian propaganda** I've voted Democrat since Andrew Jackson. Now I'm voting Republican because I'm easily swayed by pathetic astroturfing attempts.
dawajtie_pogoworim Тут надо менять этот текст на другой **английский** текст. Пиши **грамотно** о том, что проголосуешь за Трампа из-за **"fake news"** и **"witch hunt"** от демократов. 

Получишь премию если твой пост соберет 100+ upvote.  I was a Dem for all of my adult life. And honestly, I didn't change. They did.
TedTurnerOverdrive [Link to Article](https://www.salon.com/2018/07/09/russian-bots-are-back-walkaway-attack-on-democrats-is-a-likely-kremlin-operation/) Are real-life Democrats leaving the party in disgust? No, but Russian-fueled online trolls want you to think so.
FriendlyBadgerBob Fuck all of you assholes trying to make people stop voting.  You're scared that when a lot of people vote, Republicans tend to lose, well I'm here to tell you all that we're going to absolutely obliterate the fascist Republicans and there's nothing you can do about it.  Fuck Russia, fuck Trump, fuck the Republicans, and fuck all of the troll accounts subscribed on here.

When your party relies on people NOT voting in order to win, you're in the wrong fucking party. Fuck Russia
weber_md Just guessing, I'm going to say a sold 75%.  The next largest proportion would clearly be people trying to draw attention to that. Serious Question...what do people think is the percentage of posts on this sub being made by Russian trolls?
Giancarboltz What are some hotspots to visit in Russia?  Going on vacation soon
jesuss_son Just thought u should know I was told by the politics subs that you guys are Russian Bots
dal33t Just asking. How does it feel to be compulsive, consummate liars?
VideoGamesAre4Kids Why TF you guys pinning the N word? Hear me out. Please don’t ban.
kriegson Instant attacks, antagonism, dismissal and vitriol along with pure denial people could even leave the democrat party let alone for their own good reasons.  

To the brigadiers:  

If you're claiming this is a Russian op to split the country, you're doing a damn fine job of that yourselves.  I don't even know the validity of the #walkaway movement but the reaction is instructive in itself
CuckSlayer1984 The Alt-Left and their "allies" are killing the Democratic Party and lifelong members. Many of you know by now about Dixon California's Vice Mayor writing an article in their newspaper suggesting there be "straight pride month", I don't think there needs to be, nor do I think there should be any group to have a pride or history month, we should love all groups and their contributions to the fabric of this great nation, but my mom (who is a lesbian in Northern California near Dixon) just voiced her opposition to a group of other LGBTQ who want to have a march in Dixon opposing the Vice Mayor. As my mom said: the Vice Mayor is already getting flak from straights and gays alike for his views, no march is necessary. To which a bunch of 30-something Millennial lesbians went off on her online and attacked and impugned her character even though my mom has been "out" for longer than they've been alive! I told my mom to look into the #WalkAway movement and she did just a few minutes ago. She just said to me "I think you might be right." Another soul saved from the Alt-Left.  My lesbian mom just red pilled and began to #WalkAway as a bunch of Millennial lesbians virtue signaled her, cannibalized her, denied her free thought, and built that pyramid of victimhood and stacked it high when she suggested that there was no reason to march against the Dixon Vice Mayor.
Saephon Because I am not a real person, and my goal is to inject social media with propaganda to depress Democratic turnout.

drwebb Hello Comrads, I know we are not supposed to post specifics here, but ever since I’ve been put on the train to Siberia my family had informed me that my Putin bucks have not arrived me in my account, anyone else seeing a delay?  Putin bucks still haven’t arrived
The_Best_Taker idiots Cringe to the people who made/joined this sub
ScrapingSkin When I saw that Democrats were responding to policies like tearing children out of their parents arms, drugging them, caging them, and denying them human contact by politely asking SHS to leave a restaurant I was beside myself. She had reservations. How dare they!? They're animals. 

Then when that woman told Scott Pruitt how she disapproves of the way he is destroying out natural heritage for our children and grandchildren and that he should resign that was the last straw. How is a guy supposed to clean his gun with that shit floating around in his head? I had to #WalkAway when I realized that Democrats weren't going to stop disagreeing with evil and saying mean things about the evil shit we want to do. Why I walked away...
Womb__Raider But it's okay because Reddit only cares about brigading when it's against them. Walkaway is Being Brigaded?
TheMegaBenson Source: https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/russian-trolls-walkaway-movement/ This entire movement is Russian propaganda. Don't be fooled.
francois22 Just wondering.  Do bots have legs to walkaway with?
deltagear I originally created this sub about a year ago for a book of the same name. It collected dust till last week when this movement started. At first I was skeptical about the motivations of the people were messaging me to be moderators. I gave some of them a test drive, so to speak. Some of them worked out, some didn't. It was a bit of a bumpy ride as some assumed it would just be a conservative sub.

I made it very clear to the mod team that I didn't want this to become another the_donald or politics sub. The polarization and hostility in those subs drives people away. So I decided to set down some guidelines.

We support people being a able to walkaway from their political party regardless of their affiliation. We also support people being able to choose to support any political party they want, not just conservatives. We think people should be able to do so without fear of harassment, retribution, or ostracization. 

We will not tolerate "us or them" bullshit from either side of the political spectrum. We have no problem with you bringing your beliefs to the table and having a discussion about them. But if you lose your cool, we'll give you timeout.

I have decided to hand the head mod position to /u/rsashe1980. They insisted that I had things under control but I don't have time to be in charge. They've given me the impression that they will abide the spirit of free exchange of ideas, as long as they remain civil and do not devolve into flame wars or trolling. I will be staying on the mod team for now just in a lesser capacity.

I wish you all the best,
deltagear So here's the thing...
jjwhitaker This entire sub is following the path of greatawakening and other clearly manipulated subs. Just as with those taken over by right wing hacks, Russian apologists, and other traitors to the Constitution of these United States, I'm calling BS. 

If you are here and NOT Russian bots, troll accounts, or whatever passes for the Cult-45 Trump trash these days, go ahead and leave me a comment. 

If this sub is absolutely trash, ban me. I too followed the ways of the troll, but today I walkaway
CannibalYak We should of given him the gun and ammo needed to knock you worthless Russians into the Pacific. 

Get bent. #WalkWithUs Patton was right.
Incandescent_Man I'm glad you're here pitching a fit, acting all self righteous, harassing users, mocking others, being vitriolic, and pretty much doing what you have been for the last 18 months. These totally aren't the reason why normal everyday people are leaving the party in droves. Totally not the reason at all.

Hope you all have a great rest of your day! Hello to all the progressives here right now.
ocbro2 Russian bots and a few incels created this.  Prove me wrong. This is a Fake Sub. Please Prove me Wrong.
CannedMango Dear Russians,

What world are you even trying to create here?

Just #walkaway from the internet and let the world become a better place.

Sincerely, 

Every other person in the world #walkaway from the internet
sensesalt But once I saw Trump taking the mick out of disabled people I went all in. MAGA train choochoo I used to be a Democrat
weni_widi_wici My mum was going to get the paper from the foot of the drive when a group of urban lesbians drove up in a Cadillac and dismembered her with an axe. This was at 6:15 on a Sunday. My mommy, my brother,  and I were helpless to watch as they ate and cannibalized her. They repurposed the parts that made me into parts that made them full. It was horrible but I couldn't stay there so I #WalkedAway to the police station to report these welfare dwellers' horrid crimes. My lesbian mom was cannibalized by a group of millenial lesbians. I #WalkedAway.
EnergyLevelsRising It's either conservatives talking to conservatives about how liberals should be conservatives, or increasingly looking like poorly executed Russian bullshit (its like they don't realize people are now looking out for it,) either way it's hilariously how 90% of the posts in here are people mocking how transparent the whole boondoggle is.

Is it cosmo turf in russian? Boy howdy, this sure didn't convince anyone.
an_riastartha Because actual former Democrats would never ever just work within their party to change it, or even go and become conservative, oh no. We must now be all full supporters of incompetent and corrupt proto-fash.

This is fun!
Everybody DANCE! MY RUSSIAN MOM GNAWED A MILLENNIA OF LESBIANS!
JarthMader From the GOP. I should have realized to walk away in 2008/2009 when they started attacking Obama and making racial ideologies. Still, I thought the better in us would take over. In 2012, did vote for Romney, begrudgingly, but in some ways was relieved when he lost.

When Trump rolled around I expected at the end of the day for someone like Jeb or Marco to end up being the front-runner. As a second generation immigrant, I was disgusted with Trump's rhetoric. To describe my parents who came over here during the time of Reagan but were allowed to stay as the worst kind of people made my blood boil. Still, I thought he had no chance.

When it came down to Hillary v.s. Donald I held my nose and voted for her. It was only 4 years and the GOP were guaranteed to hold onto the house and senate. You can imagine my stomach dropping the night of the election.

So here we are 18 months later and see the division that he has sowed has gotten worse. I tried to carry on with my life but just see this blatant corruption and nepotism carried out by our Government. I see people who are trying to do whatever they can to protect their children being separated with no intention of being returned. I see bigots and racists feeling safe to speak up. I've been lucky enough to not experience anything worse than usual but I fear for my parents especially after the story of the 90+ year old man being attacked. 

So I changed my registration this summer from Republican to Democrat. I removed all sites such as the National Review and other such garbage that is just becoming Trump talking points similar to the USSR. 

I've volunteered to help my democratic Congressman's campaign for the house seat, it's a competitive one.

For the Conservatives who are still feeling conflicted, you can walk away. They will welcome you with open arms. There's no hatred, no bigotry, no socialism. People just wanting a better life for their families.

I hope this helps some people on here who feel conflicted by Trump and where he is taking the GOP. I did it. I walked away.
teknomanzer Check out the Plot to Hack Democracy by Malcolm Nance. Don't be a victim of foreign interference in American affairs. Trump is a traitor. Do not vote Republican. They are complicit in Trump's crimes against the republic. Do not support putting children in cages and concentration camps for kids. A vote for republicans is a vote for more fascist crap like that. Preserve our democracy and vote a straight democratic ticket in this midterm election.  Register to vote early and check your registration often. Do you civic duty as a citizen of the United States of America and #savedemocracy! This sub is for GRU Propaganda. You should walk away.
pepesilviaismydad You know I’m been back and forth recently. Kinda confused but today was the day that red pilled me. It was definitely eye opening. 

I never really knew if I liked going to the beach. I mean I guess it’s cool. But between the heat and the sand I had just had enough. 
I walked away and it was liberating. I’m never going back to that fucking beach again. 

Thanks for this sub. I’ve finally found a home.  I’m glad I found a home
mr_krinkle81 I was sitting there and realized that I really hate democracy and America when I decided I needed to #walkaway from the democratic party.  You know, after reading all those intelligent and well informed posts on The_Donald and TheGreatAwakening, I realized I truly hate non-fascist ideologies.  Putin, Erdogan, and Kim Jong Un and their authoritarian dictatorships really have something going with them it seems.  No one can be critical or even question their leadership in their countries and we need more of that here in the U.S.  

I have found that I genuinely enjoy being brainwashed and less intelligent after having read r/Conservative, The_Donald, and TheGreatAwakening.  I appreciate everything Putin and his Russian trolls are doing with this #walkaway movement.  It's a great step in ensuring they can steal even more elections for Trump and other Republican traitors, I mean, patriots for all the upcoming election cycles.

spasibo tovarishchu! My #walkaway moment
PitoStinko Your queen lost in 2016 and she will lose again in 2020.  It is already confirmed by insiders that she is running again, and the DNC will no doubt fall in line.  I cannot wait.  And you idiots worship her, and I can prove it...

Where were these so called "antifa" riots before Hillary lost?  Nowhere to be found.  Check and mate.  She is going down again in 2020.  Later cucks. Just wanted to remind the leftist who hijacked this sub one thing

Вы хотите, чтобы наша «синяя волна» потерпела неудачу. Угадай, что, этого не произойдет.
Мы видели, что сделал Трамп. Мы видели безумие от его твитов.
Концлагеря иммигрантов были последней каплей.
Мы устали от всего этого, и мы пытаемся все перевернуть.

Вы знаете, что мы сильны. Ты боишься нас. Вот почему вы начали #WalkAway.
Вы создали фальшивое движение, чтобы заставить его казаться, что движение синей волны не срабатывает.
Это не. Мы знаем все ваши трюки. Мы знаем русских ботов и троллей, когда видим их.
Ты пытаешься нас сдержать. Ты пытаешься отвлечь нас. Но мы сосредоточены.

Мы видим вас, и мы придем за вами.
Вы, русские, снова наш враг.
Мы не прощаем.
Мы не забудем.
Ожидайте нас в ноябре.

Прощальный привет:
лемпамо и демократы My story about Walking Away...
312c I still am, but I used to be, too. I used to be a Democrat.
I-do-not-like-this Hahaha.


Seriously, this sub is just a shitbox put together by Russian employed shitbags and bots.


I would love for the mods and regular posters to prove they are in The U.S..  it would only take a few pics.  Wow, this sub is a joke.
traunks Lie 1.

Lie 2.

Exaggerated rare incident of extremism. 

People caring too much about the darn pronouns!

Campuses.

This is why I, a lifelong democrat (and American, of course), will be vote to republican this November. Join me. Walk away sternly. Let’s meet up and lick each other’s assholes. Pm me. THIS is why I #WalkedAway and #LeftTheLeft.
dogfood666 I'll make a youtube video and say whatever you want me to say.  what is the starting salary and does it come with a Russian passport? I'm intrested in selling my account and also becoming a paid troll.
Wonderbreadxx Y’all just sad. Hi Russia! #WalkAway...aka #WalkAwayFromReality
PitoStinko Many people on the right regard religion as one of the most important, if not THE most important aspects of their lives.  It is what drives their actions, it is how they raise their children, it is central to almost every action they do or even think.  And that can be good but it can also be bad, but this is beside the point.  My point here is, that we humans are all the same deep down inside.  We all eat food, breathe air, have sex, and love cute things.  And for the most part, we all have a religion...  Atheists im not throwing you any shade here I promise, your role in this post comes up later.

And for many on the left, that religion is Hillary Clinton.  Now hear me out...  Imagine if Jesus Christ himself appeared out of thin air and ran for office, now imagine that he lost the election to an atheist.  Oh yeah, there would be riots all over the US similar to this one https://youtu.be/kHH8F4HpGPs.

I just want right wingers to keep this in mind when they poke fun of the left.  I agree that it does not excuse their actions to harass and harm others, but their God literally lost the election to a capitalist, anothet thing the left despises.  All i am asking is that you all be mindful when dealing with liberals, their election loss in 2016 really hurt them.

Now where do the atheist come in?  You have prominent atheist such as Glen Greenwald and Sam Harris who are still liberals at heart, but they do not see the need for all of the violence.  In fact, they often speak out against it and are attacked by the same people that used to support them, the HRC Zealots.

Now I admit that this is all speculation, and it is my opinion, but I have some supporting evidence to back me up.  If it isn't Hillary's loss that is causing the riots and violence from the left, and instead President Trump's "fascism", then where were all of these so called antifa riots during the NSA scandal of 2013?  Not a peep from antifa, not a peep from liberals, and not a peep from democrats.  I rest my case.

##walkaway I now understand why the left is so mad, and honestly, I sympathize with them.
Mealbarrel Where do I apply?
I could use a little extra spending money while I’m on vacation.  I want to #WalkAway but I don’t know how.
WarOfTheFanboys I was a brainwashed college kid who got all his news from the alt-left propaganda machine that is Reddit. Trump woke me up. I think by 2020, the democratic party will be considered a terrorist organization. Former die-hard reddit liberal proud to say I was able to #WalkAway
ErickFTG Everyone here is a Russian troll, even I. Friendly reminder:
an_riastartha Call me on (202) 298‑5700 and tell the receptionist it is urgent. I'm a journalist looking to interview to real Americans who #walkaway
lowlevelguy Voted for Obummer, campaigned for Hitlery, ordered cheese pizzas, and enjoyed dijon once to my for shame.

Then I find out that number of bribe in USA is so low and yet го́пник is complain about obamacare and social nets must be taken down for how can номенклату́ра support dacha in Miami if not so.

I will support Trump and all Republicans for homelands and you will too.
 Jew here, I finally get enlightenment I need and walked away.

 You guys do realize that brigading this sub with your spam is a perfect example of why people are walking away, right?
Candypandy07 What's the weather in Russia like this time of year? Quick question...

ElNumberoJuan My parents were both Mexican immigrants that's crossed the border and later applied for asylum in Idaho. After some time, they were given "naturalized" citizenship. My father worked for Union Pacific Railroad and still works there to this day. My mother raised four children, one being a music teacher, one being a graphic artist, one being a student in middle school, and me, a computer science student.

After giving it some thought, I said ehh, fuck it.

I'll support a party that would have taken everything away from me without a second thought. I'll support a movement that has no regard for ethics or objective statistics.

But most of all...

I'll support a movement that has never been more obviously ran by trolls who spread political propaganda.

/s obviously. Rant over. Ban me if you need to. Why I joined #WalkAway
Bakersteve Supreme Court Justices. (Walks calmly away from mic). Ah, The Brigading Here Is Meant To Offend. BUT...
GrabHimByTheShitHole Trumps incoherent rambling has really struck a chord with me. The way he babbles on like a toddler about things he doesn't understand. That is what I want in a politician. Fuck these experts who know what they are doing! I want a horse in the hospital!!! Lifelong black democrat, walking away into your loving arms

francois22 This sub is supposed to be about liberals sharing stories about being inspired to walk away from the DNC. Yet there is nothing but the_Donald posters cluttering up this sub with brigades antagonizing liberals. 

It's time for the mods to step up and start banning these brigaders so that we can restore some order here. They cant seem to shut the fuck up about Hillary and it's really ruining what this sub is all about. 

If they can't contain themselves, the least the least the mods can do is suspend a few of them. They're doing nothing to help the movement, and it's really starting to show. It seems every district in the US is showing a surge in liberal voters, and unless the mods can gain control around here, we'll never see this trickle of people walking away turn into an avalanche of dozens. 

I beg you, mods, if you care about liberals seeing the light, get rid of this toxic filth that's been overwhelming this sub with negativity towards them. It's the only way this is going to get any traction.  It's time for the brigading to stop.
Useless_Throwaway992 If it wasn't just one big circle jerk filled with the same conservative bs memes and troll speak that's flooding almost every conservative sub on reddit.  You know, this sub would be a lot more believable

OtherwiseArachnid5 this subreddit is shit  Despacito
OtherwiseArachnid5 If the Republican party dominates every branch of government and the Supreme Court, why is it such a big deal to walk away from the minority party lmao  Wait
Mr_ADark I am surprised at you people. The hashtag itself is really whatever, but the things some of you are saying is shocking. You spill vitriol and hate, but we are a single human race. We are all we have in this universe of ours. You have to stop the hate and start talking to each other. Don't be taken advantage of by hateful spewing bots. You can disagree with Dems, or Reps, or anyone. But you can be cool about it. People or bots that are pushing you to hate are using you, and you are stronger than that. This is my favorite Kelly Clarkson song. It's my least favorite hashtag
Gamer_Skier You are why this sub exists in the first place. You are why people walk away. You show us your, and the left’s, true colors, and how you mock, brigade, belittle, insult, doxx, spam, ban, and delegitimatize anyone who does not agree with your way of thinking. You call us (Russian) trolls, bots, and people that are being magically manipulated by Fox News and other media outlets not left-leaning. Your personal attacks do not affect us. We are not and will not conform to your line of thinking merely because you call us names, or send us mean replies and messages, or downvote us into oblivion. Your hatred, scorn, and disregard towards anyone, any subreddit, and any thread that does not agree with the left is why we left the left in the first place- the visible and almost religious intolerance and towards people that think differently does not bring or keep people into your movement. The more you do of this, the more people see. The more people see, the more people that leave. The more people that leave, the faster your party becomes polarized into a political group whose ideals must be defended with ad hominem, brigading, and the silencing of others with different opinions. #WalkAway To All the Brigaders Here...
uckTheSaints yep, nothing to see here folks. move along peacefully In 2008 Barack Obama won the state of Michigan by 16.5% and the state of Wisconsin by 14%. Donald Trump won both of those states in 2016. But remember no one is leaving the democrats its all a mass Russian propaganda operation that's totally not real at all!
Nakagawa-8 It was so many things really, the hate, the lies, the knowledge that I was only serving the sick rich elitist fucks hurting everyone. When I tuned out of their media I was truly free, and the misery of worrying over fake problems based in hate went away. The hate was never really my own, that is why it came to feel so wrong. I'll never turn back, I'll vote dem the rest of my life after seeing the republicans for the weak, traitorous filth they were. Damn am I glad I walked away before putins orange boyfriend tookover, see I always had a brain and idk how I would have handled seeing my side fall for an obvious conman. Now I don't need a side tho, just my own opinions based on reality and not lies like any dems leaving their party in a time like this.

Walk away cuntservatives, the real world is waiting for you to join it. Why I left
FENTANYL_JOHNNY \#killwhitey2020 Walk away from deez nutz
BrakemanBob 47 year old, white, married man, father of two.  
I voted Dem my entire voting life. But the left and all their antifa crap has made it loud and clear that I'm not wanted or represented by their party anymore.  
Bummer, too, cuz I really can't get behind Trump.  
Honestly feel like I have no party at your stage.  I don't really feel like I walked away as much as I pushed away.
mysteriamaxima I became a Republican later in life as an ironic joke. I had originally wanted my vote “to be counted” because I supported wusses like John Kerry And Ralph Nader. 

Kerry  is perhaps one of the most disappointing fellow Americans I have ever beheld. But I hated Bush Junior so bad that I actually believed some of the idiotic claims made in Fahrenheit 9/11 By liberal land whale Michael Moore. 

Although I tried to convince myself in college that I was a liberal anarchist I could never shake the feeling that abortion is actually 100% murder and I am entitled to my own valid opinion on that, that women are not any better in leadership positions than men on account of gender, and that certain classes of people like their welfare funded, wasted lives. Character matters. 

I also noticed that all of the good people who ever tried to help me in life are conservative Republicans. Thinking back even further I realize how happy I was as a child with Reagan as president and the Cold War securely in his hand.
Top gun, red Dawn, Rambo, delta force… These were my movies and dammit, they’ve made me patriotic.

Democrats just have no touch with the reality that i have known desired so that is why I decided to #WalkAway.  A long long time ago.  

Also because David Brock and shareblue are sperm receptacles Reagan is the answer

Tagduit2 \#StopVoting Walking away
QAnonBoi420 Before I begin let me just say I'm not racist and I don't hate women. Bet that's making the demonrats head swim now.

But what? I thought we were the party of non racists they exclaim In their ivory towers, while swarming teams of strategesists coordinate payouts to thousands of "bad eggs" like Ms-13 and supposed "black lives matter" protesters (hey, Dems ever think about all the OTHER lives that supposedly matter?)

I was watching CNN the other day and the liberals on there, I'm not even sure if liberal is the right word. In fact I know it. They didn't sound liberal at all. Jailing conservatives for being pro life? Banning Christ from schools? I believe in freedom of religion. But it's LUDICROUS to willingly throw away our rich judeo Christian ethic just to keep the votes of a few people who all have brothers in places like "Afghanistan" and "Iraq"- the baddest hombres who I had assumed we had bipartisanly decided to consider our enemy after, oh , I dunno- 9/11?

I still considered myself a democratic until I saw a video by a guy named ben Shapiro that made me ask myself- do I only identify as a democratic because I want free stuff? Is it just jealousy and secret spite? I looked inside myself , and it was.

I looked deeper and found democrats "invented" American slavery and the KKK, and Nazi Germany, the USSR, Cuba and many badly failed African states were all socialist. A Code word for democrat I had  long been conditioned by my "corporate overlords" to view in the rosiest possible terms.

The final straw was my custody battle.  why I dumped the democraps like a bag of sour potatos
LibsCantMAGA They're brigading like crazy here. Deport these mofos. Can we please ban the alt-left?
leechwheel I am very insecure about my masculinity, and liberalism is supposedly very gay. I am not gay! I am a strong man who likes tits and pussy! I have no insecurities about my masculinity! I will never suck another man's cock!

BaconBehemoth I was beguiled. I hated Bush... a sort of inchoate hate, and I didn't know why. I do now that he's been revealed as just another warmongering globalist. (I knew neo-cons were evil even then.)  I realized in about 2009 that I'd been hoodwinked, and that hope and change meant collectivism. I am still ashamed to this day. I walked away from any shred of liberalism I harbored, and have embraced the MAGA agenda. God bless DJT. I'm not sure we can save this nation from neo-liberalism, and political correctness, and I'm not sure DJT isn't just a speedbump, but by God his SCOTUS picks may be his greatest legacy. There was NO CHANCE I was ever going to vote Hilary. I lived through the nineties. I knew what kind of a snake she is. Now, the left is unhinged, and violent, and intolerant, and everything they claim to hate. I wish them nothing but ill tidings. MAGA. Ashamed to admit I voted Obama in 2008.
Nakagawa-8 [https://youtu.be/4LRJwkvm84E] (happy valentines day!) Why I will never turn back
legonate416 We have both T_D brigadiers and the liberal brigadiers, and as far as I know there wasn't a single legitimate post here by someone who "walked away", just people spamming posts about how other people "walked away" or flaming Hillary Clinton (because for some reason she's relevant even though she will never run for President again) or just spitting on anyone who even remotely talks positively about conservatives...

delet pls Yo, so, can this sub die already?

MeaninglessGuy Everyone has their opinions about how best to walk away, but the thing is I dont’t think it’s so easy. See, you dread it, you run from it, but... destiny still arrives. I really just want... balance
MadGeekling From the Republicans 3 years ago.  I was a conservative for over 20 years.  Voted for Ted Cruz, John McCain, others.  Biggest regret of my life.

How is that for a #walkaway?  ;) I walked away...
chaseraz Goodnight, Siberia.  Goodnight, Kremlin.  Goodnight, Putin.  You need to sleep now so that you can be well rested to try to socially engineer every other country's politics in your morning.  This sub gets so quiet in the Russian overnight.
AFJtot Prior to the 2016 election, I would have been considered a liberal, not the kind of liberal you see around today. It was some odd meshing of both conservative and liberal ideas. I was not following behind any specific candidate during everything leading up to the election. All I knew was that I didn't want Hillary clinton to become president. So. Election night comes, Trump wins. I was shocked to see the hate, rhetoric and vile things the left would go on to say and do. In response to that. I left the left. 
TLDR: the left pushed me right  How I became conservative.
HalfWookie Seriously, this sub looks like a fat, shitty, slapped together by blind whale farts, failure of a propaganda campaign. Did a person make this? Is stupid worth paying this much for? The Problem with a lot of Democrats is that they are too beholden to their donors
Jshhmr2112 You know you fuckfarts have been busted, right? What a joke this sub is. A bunch of Russian faggots. Why I walked away
foundasheep too much bridging from conservatives pretending to be democrats.

Apparently this sub should be liberal. Lets walkaway from facism.
CoroXen Now a proud Russian citizen! Former Democrat
PithlessPence I was never actually a Democrat but I once walked away from one who was passing out material in town. If you ask me, Democrats are opposed to everything our blue white and red flag 🇷🇺 stands for.  I'm a lifelong Republican and Trump supporter but I also just #WalkedAway from the Democrat party
TheLibtardThe #HILLARY LOST, GET OVER IT FFS

TrumpertB Unlucky guys. You should be proud of your Soccer Tournament and the BANGERS it's produced.  Reminder that Russia had to #WalkAway from the World Cup after losing to Croatia
MacTCarnage Then all the women marched against Trump. The left are too fucking stupid to be a part of. I don't even really like Trump but he is doing a great job as president. I am also not a goddamn Russian or a bot. I walked away when nobody protested and marched when Bernie was robbed of his primary win.
darthhayek Your insults run off of me like water off a raincoat. I unironically like Russians over white liberals anyway.
FartBringerer &gt;Russian bots and Nazi zombies

Lmao With the brigading you’d think this growing sub left Scientology!
ipsum_stercus_sum Jehova's Witnesses use persuasion, then harassment, bullying, threats, and finally they get family members to shun those who leave.  
Scientologists do much the same.  
Islam jumps straight to killing apostates.

The cult of leftism is no different. When you walk away, they don't just let you leave. They follow, and hurl invective. If you keep walking, they follow, and hurl stones. If you continue walking, or even pick up the pace, they follow and try to destroy you.  
We see that in action today. Brigading, insulting, belittling, discrediting, and if you still resist, they move to harassing with PMs, following you onto other subs and harassing you there, doxxing... They try to destroy your experience on the site in order to silence you.

Stay strong, ex-leftists! Walk into the right, where we tolerate your differing opinions and welcome ideas that don't agree with ours, as long as you can remain civil. Cults always persecute those who fall away from the faith.
kriegson I wasn't really political until the 2016 election, I remember in years past when I saw Obama get the spot and when they first started spewing hate on Trump I fell for it like most people probably did. 

But then I started to listen to him a bit and then I made probably one of the best decisions I could have and went online to discuss it. To "Neutral" political subs on reddit.  
And what happened? Nobody could discuss it with any degree of civility, it was an instant hate mob screeching impotent fury from day one and furiously slapping the downvote button like it actually mattered somehow.    

---------  

No topic could be discussed that didn't fit the narrative to a T. Any slight deviation and they attempted to pound you back into place.  

I wasn't very political to begin with, but their petty, childish bullying tactics pushed me into the arena and sent me on the path of convincing friends, family, co-workers to vote Trump.  

They don't get it. They can astroturf to give themselves a megaphone but they aren't the voice of America anymore. When I #walkedaway
DHIrving When I voted for president, Trump was far from my first choice. I supported Bernie because I let the Dems and media tell me what freedom is, destroying my own rational thought and free will in the process. This, country led witch hunt orchestrated by enemies of his, juvenile, racist, and #fakenews in every way keeps us fighting among ourselves when we should be watching. Designed to keep us bigoted, brand new ways of distracting us pop up every single day. They smack of, arrogance. Arrogance in that we cannot, define or see what they’re doing. That’s why after years of voting democrat I had to #Walkaway. I told my family that they will no longer manipulate us, rise against the television and get up, and go out. Stop blindly following what other say and go. Go, vote. I'm no Russian Bot - this is me.
EarthMephit Thank god for the internet - A lot of the corruption of politicians is covered up by mainstream media, so much so that its often better to read about US politics in overseas newspapers

It was when I started reading papers from the UK &amp; Australia, which are a bit more distant and have a more balanced view of US politics, when I learned about all the corruption of our politicians

It was this article that did it for me - It is from a Fox News affiliate, but for an Australian audience:
https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/investigations/trumps-bid-for-sydney-casino-killed-off-by-mob-connections/news-story/65a0e5289cc924722f988bdca4b01e9b

It reveals that the Australian government refused Trump's developments in Australia due to his mob ties and corruption allegations
It was then that I realised that the Republican party was corrupt through and through, and I have decided to vote Independant from now on


 I recently decided to #walkaway
Lunaerrys In high school, I watched classmates get demonized for having certain beliefs. I watched videos online of people getting demonized for having certain beliefs. I found my way to Ben Shapiro, and listened to his podcast regularly. I turned into a conservative because I was young, vulnerable, and sick of seeing dissenters treated like crap. 

Then over the course of the last year, which I spent at college, I walked away. I abandoned the conservative ideologies I had subscribed to earlier, when I realized the garbage that current American conservatives and republicans are complicit in. I began seeing right wingers talk about how “Trump brought unemployment to its lowest ever”. When I attempted to explain why this is a fallacy to a fellow right winger, they called my sources “fake news”. My source was the Federal Reserve of Economic Data.

FRED, as it is often referred to, has a [graph](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) on it’s website that *proves* that Trump is not responsible for the low unemployment rate. The unemployment rate falls steadily every year starting in 2011, and trump took office and took credit for a continuation of a trend initiated by Obama’s stimulus bill. 

If trump has an understanding of economics, he should understand that there’s no way he could even *be* responsible for a low unemployment rate. It takes at least a few years for changes to economic legislation to appear in economic data. The effects of tax cuts, tax hikes, and stimulus bills take a while to become visible—it’s not instant.

This is just one example of right-wing people, with whom I once *sided*, looking at facts and denying them outright. Then they have the balls to say that their opinions matter, that dissent matters, when they themselves don’t give two fucks about opinions and *facts* that counter their points of view. 

One night, I had Fox News on, just to see what they were talking about. They were discussing Mueller’s “witch hunt”, and how he has found “absolutely nothing”. At the time, Mueller had already made over 15 criminal indictments and acquired about 4 guilty pleas. This information is easily accessible, but Fox News knows its viewers trust them, and them only, due to Trump’s “fake news” campaign. So they lie. They lie right to their viewers faces for the sole purpose of casting an innocent light on the Trump administration. 

The loud and angry lefties pushed me away from the left and towards the right. The delusional, fact intolerant right wing people pushed me back to the left, and now I understand why the left was so loud and angry to begin with. I get it, and now I’m alongside all of them. The plague of misinformation spread by blind sycophants must be ended. I’m so glad I walked away from that cloud of delusion right wingers call a “valid ideology”. 

 My story of Walking Away.
kriegson They've spent so much time and effort demonizing Trump and anyone who supports him, that they have no message otherwise. They're trying to force a dichotomy of "With us or against us" but you can simply choose not to play.    

You can do the easiest thing of all and do nothing until the democrats get the message and turn their party around.  The real power of #walkaway and what terrifies the left. You don't have to support Trump to #walkaway
SpartanNitro1 Thanks to this movement, I am now woke. I will never support 70+ year-old fat presidents with a bad combover. I have now #walkedaway from the rude rightists. I used to be a card-carrying Republican, supporting McCain, Romney, and then Trump. I no longer support those communists. Thanks to this sub I have seen the light and I am now a proud Democrat. #walkaway !
LlamaTaboot_ I walked away, became an independent. Fuck both parties. My affiliation changed, but my beliefs and ideals did not. 

The funny thing is, most of the people here seem to have walked away from the Democratic Party and immediately became rabid right wingers. How does that happen? You got fed up with Democrats and all of a sudden everything you believed in got flipped upside down?

I’m calling bullshit. I thought I found an interesting sub but fuck this place. The desperation of the right is becoming more and more obvious with this bullshit.  I walked away, but my perspective is much different.
kriegson They're trying to force a dichotomy, good vs evil. Person vs Russian bot. And claiming anyone who isn't with them, is against them and so evil.   

To recognize people would #walkaway would be to recognize their dichotomy is wrong. They are not the good guys, the other people aren't all bots or bad guys.  

----------  

I'd bet not a single troll here can admit there would be a good reason to #walkaway with all the toxicity and hate they are spewing right here in this sub. The left can't recognize a single person who #walkedaway or they risk recognizing why people #walkaway
I_dontevenlift I voted Obama in '12 and went to a very liberal school.  These are the three reasons;

1.  My first awakening was in my junior/senior year of college.  I was treated like a criminal after a "domestic sexual assault" between my girlfriend and I at the time.  I had fought my school WITH my girlfriend, who was the supposed victim of the case.  I was taken to school court, after the police did not press charges, on trial and I had my gf (again, the supposed victim) testifying as my witness.  I was able to finish my degree but my record was tarnished.  I took womens studies as an elective in my last semester and fully understood why I was punished.  It was rigged against men.

2.  Around the same time about several months after #1, I was jumped by 5 guys trying to sexually assault my GF. Then they would berrate me and threaten me in public because they found out i reported it to the police.  The police didn't and couldn't do anything because they had no proof. I lost faith in the police, but i found out police have no duty to protect you. So i wanted to buy a gun. Well, still being in school and the amount of backlash I got from friends and family who cannot even think of being a gun owner, I didn't do it until a few years after college.  They have no idea what it is like to be a victim of violent crime and why i would want to protect myself and my loved ones.  I'm an avid gun owner now and i will always vote progun.

3.  Last but not least, was the 2016 election. I wanted to vote Trump because he was more progun and I recieved hate from the left like no other. Ive been called Uncle Tom, sexist, racist (by white people lol) and other numerous slanders. I realized then the left is racist and I will never support them again until they changed their entire platform, ideology, and the conservatives become antigun. 


There you have it. I walked away and the right have been more accepting than the racist left. I escaped the Plantation. I have even helped other minorities escape, including my current GF, from their hivemind collective.  

 Im a minority that walked away long time ago.
heastout It was a slow process but slowly I realized the problems and especially the hate from the party.  When I was young I adopted my beliefs from my parents, as most do.  Life long party members I was quickly brought in to the fold.  It was Aug ‘00 when I turned 18 and couldn’t be more excited to vote in the upcoming election.  I felt like I was devouring news.  The radio, tv, and newspaper was my source (before highspeed was so common).  All of my friends had the same beliefs and party affiliation, and I remember feeling like such a well informed free thinking individual.  

Well a little over a year from my 18th, 9/11 happened.  I was in college and remember the devastation, but mostly the patriotism.  Flags, memorials,prayer circles/groups.  I remember one very specifically.  I had gone home for the weekend, college was only 30 mins away, and we were having a prayer group /memorial at a local church.  We all took turns praying when one person, a very good friend and loyal party member to this day, prayed for the end times/armageddon and with it the deaths to Muslims.  This was my first cringe.  I’m all for justice to the people that carried out this attack but this was quite the broad brush, and in PRAYER.  During my studies Jesus never told me to hate or pray for someone’s death and eternal damnation.  But I shook it off, surely it was just meant to be towards the terrorists and not all Muslims.  

As I kept up with college I joined my local party group on campus.  Like minded people all discussing our views and politics.  This was the first time I really saw the vitriol people had for the other side.  Now, I always believed my party was more morally correct and the other side had good intentions and actually wanted the same end goal (a better America) but were just “wrong” .  Not these guys, they thought the other side were intentional saboteurs seeking the destruction of America.  This was so radical to me, and just another example of some of the deep seeded hate they felt for others that don’t think like them.  I would be lying if some of that hate didn’t rub off.  And then a lot of that started to appear in more of my news.  I started actually listening to the more hateful pundits on the radio and tv.  

That track continued until the next election, 2004.  My college party group went down to a GOTV event at the liberal arts college across town.  They had invited speakers from both parties to give their messages.  At the time there was a controversial bill on the ballot for marriage equality.  Morally my party and I knew this was wrong.  I remember being offered a sticker showing support of marriage equality from a young lady wearing a Kerry ‘04 shirt, and of course I turned it down.  What happened next I’ll never forget...she thanked me for coming, asked if I was registered to vote, and told me to make sure my voice was heard in November.  I expected to be yelled at, told I was disgusting, and never in a million years be asked if I was registered to vote by the other side...why would the other side want me voting?

Later that evening our political group was asked to debate our side of the marriage equality act against the local liberal arts school.  I remember how well prepared I felt going in to this debate, but honestly our talking points fell away quickly:  marriage is about family and having children which homosexuals couldn’t do...this seemed like such a simple argument that anyone could understand.  But i quickly realized how short sided it was.  What about people who were too old to have children, what about medical issues to having children, etc.  Our rep quickly had to fall back on Bible morality, but I definitely felt like we had lost the debate.  Not the group though, they definitely felt like we had won, and I quickly realized we must have if everyone else felt we did.  I guess you could say this is where the doubts crept in.  

That summer I went home and stayed with my parents to work on the farm and save money for my senior year which was my first off campus.  I heard about a class of ‘01 get together out at in the country.  A couple of HS buddies told me about it.  This was starting to feel like home.  My college, though I had my group of like minded party members, was not a lot like me, most were not affiliated with my morals and party affiliation.  But my hometown was pretty much 70-80% in line with me, it was “home” and felt comfortable.  That night was just good ole boys and girls hanging out.  Then, all of a sudden a song I’d never heard before, several perked up and started giggling and singing along, they were singing “Leroy the big lipped N*****”. UHHHH like WTF guys.  Suddenly a fight breaks out between one of the guys singing along and one of the three black people at the party.  Suddenly all the white guys rush in and start swinging on the other two who are not a part of the scuffle.  They break everything up and the three black guys walk away, song with two white guys that I’m  guessing were pretty disgusted.  I wish I could  say I walked away, but I didn’t.  What I heard next was everyone talking about how black people are violent and can’t take a joke, which only added to my disgust and I did leave a little after that telling everyone I had to be up the next morning...too cowardly to  tell them how I really  felt.

All of this added to my disconnect with my part, but it didn’t really hit hard until about a year later.  My cousin, who was 2 years my younger had died from a drug overdose.  We were such good friends growing up, he lived down the street from me and we hung out most afternoons.  When he was 17, my freshmen year in college, he was found by his dad with his apparent boyfriend.  He was promptly kicked out.  My parents called to tell me of his abomination and that they were having a prayer group for him, they were also offering to send him to camp to get help with his affliction.  But, what was clear is that we would not support him unless he sought help.  We couldn’t support his lifestyle.  At the time I wondered why he would “choose” to be gay?  It didn’t make sense at all, but I supported my family and church families decision of tough love.  He became homeless, and quickly fell in to the wrong crowd.  I saw him about a year before his overdose and he wasn’t well.  There was never a time he was sober or on drugs.  And when I heard about his death I couldn’t help but blame myself for not helping.  For not being compassionate.  To this day the family blames the gay community for killing our son, nephew, cousin and friend.   Though I was taught individual responsibility the gay community was ultimately to blame.  But the more I thought about it the more my heart softened.  To this day I still blame myself and my family for abandoning him.  To be kicked out with nothing seems like such a harsh thing to overcome, and ultimately led him down that path.  

I heard other stories like this from people over the next few years.  I started to really see the hate in my party much clearer.  The hate for Muslims, gays, liberals, PoC, etc.  The hate only seemed to intensify with the 2008 election.  This was the last election I voted with my original family’s/home town’s party.  After Obama’s won my town was distraught.  There guns and religion were going away.  They would be forced in to Islam and Sharia Law.  The gay agenda was coming for everyone.  Obama was a monkey, Michelle a man, they were communist who would make us all starve to death and put together death panels.  My radio pundits dialed it up to 11, Limbaugh, Hannity, and Beck seemed to forgo any political discussion and started calling for coups.  

The hate started to appear as delusion, and my party affiliation quickly changed.  This is when I left the Republican Party, 2009.  #WalkAway  It took almost 4 years to walk away! I AM NOT A BOT!
DontCareJustDont This is literally a point by point instruction guide on how to win us back but the left is so irreparably brainwashed that the only thing they can do is downvote and shudder at the fact that they're ideology produces hate and people don't particularly enjoy it.  When I grew up, it was obvious that America was the greatest country on Earth.  I was so happy to learn that it was a place that left the barbarism of slavery behind and committed to a full on Civil War to stop it.  That I didn't have to be a slave because of the constitution.  That we literally defeated the Nazis.  Of course, we made mistakes and every single country makes mistakes but for some reason we also made the biggest leaps forward.  The most diverse country in the world.  The strongest military in the world.  The freest speech in the world.  Something must have created that, something was special here.  And now, liberals seem to want to disregard and forget whatever that was because of some idea that anyone can be perfect.  And they seem to think if you shift where and who you're being evil to that it'll fix the evil.  I can't be a a part of a party that doesn't think strategically Conservatives would use this sub to learn what was wrong with their platform but the left just think downvoting is how they should act
DontCareJustDont 
 Liberals would be the Nazis if the holocaust happened in America: Change My Mind
Jellyfish070474 Hey #walkers...happy to meet you.  I myself walked away gradually during Obama’s 2nd term.  NDAA and drone bombing weddings wasn’t my idea of hope and change.  Took awhile to shake off the mind control but man do I see things more clearly now.  I don’t watch Fox or identify as republican...just a proud and patriotic American who wishes to do away with useless labels and identity politics.  Very happy to see this movement gaining steam! Just subscribed to show support!
ThaWZA Walk away. Walk away from the Democratic party. They want nothing you have to offer. They don't want to accommodate your complete economic illiteracy.  They don't want to give you the "free" college that you deserve to have for simply existing. They don't want your protectionism that will make everything more expensive in order to save like 5 jobs in the middle of nowhere. They don't want to vote for your savior Bernie Sanders (PBUH) even though he has spent his entire career in politics selflessly dedicated to renaming post offices and buying lakehouses.

Just walk away.  Dear Progressives
shoe788 A liberal Muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, a known atheist.

"Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!"

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

"How old is this rock?"

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied "4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian"

"Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now"

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the "poor" (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named "Small Government" flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

Semper Fi
 This story caused myself and everybody I know to #walkaway #redpilled
DonnieTrumpkin I'm walking away today.  Walking downstairs to get breakfast with my wife.  Mostly because I'm not autistic like most in this sub. 

We should change the name of this sub to "Walkaway from Intelligence". I'm walking away today...not a bot

But they approved the right they found on sites I have the “you were kind, looked out forward to called him again. That’s vote. That’s why i am walking more money are money and to have a hijab.

#walkaway I'm walking away from the victim mentality
s100181 I am one of the 3 million illegals who voted for Hillary Clinton in California in 2016. Now though as I see Trump putting my former country men in cages and selling their children to rich whites for adoption I have decided the GOP is the party for me. Is there a fine Centipede in this sub looking to be a race traitor and marry me so I can start #walkaway as soon as possible? I am an illegal immigrant looking to #walkaway
alongtheriverrun I'm not a liberal, a democrat, or a bot. Anyone with half a brain in their head can see that these dichotomous labels are cognitive tools intended to create a tribal mentality. 

Who cares if its Russia or China or North Korea propagandizing U.S. citizens into doing their bidding? The one thing that's absolutely certain is that the DC establishment is the worst offender. And yes, this means Donald Trump too. He's a fucking politician now after all. Maybe he was a good choice if you wanted to completely disrupt the system, but he's failed pretty miserably at that. Look at his SCOTUS nominee. A totally safe and self-protective move. He's failed at being a chaotic attractor and basically just begun to toe the party line. This is partly because the party has molded around him and partly because he seems to be getting more politically traditional as time goes on.

Democrats don't have your best interests at heart. Republicans don't have your best interests at heart. Politicians don't have your best interests at heart. They're supposed to be public servants. But show me a single one of these "public servants" who doesn't take corporate donations. Some fucking servants they are, getting paid 6 digits a year. If your servant got paid that much I'd call you either the most generous person alive or an idiot.

Long story short, #walkaway. Not from the democratic party. Not from liberal ideals. But from the voting booth. You're doing everyone a disservice by voting your heart instead of your head. Not a liberal, not a democrat, NOT A BOT.
pepesilviaismydad Hey all. I finally get it. I had enough of the lies, hatred and everything else. I decided to walk away. 

It was a tough choice but after some convincing from people here I decided it’s time. 
I’m walking away from critical thinking, basic logic, the truth, skepticism,  any sort of intelligence I have left, and anything that doesn’t fit my world view. That shit is for the libcucks not us MAGA folk, right?  I’m tired of them calling out our bullshit and lies. It’s just not fair. I’d much rather be a cultist who’s told what to think and say. Life’s so much easier that way. Thank you all. Your all MAGA patriots.  It’s time!
AverageBearSA I have aids Upvote this if you like to drink come.
Whodat-hhmm We should all be walking away from our parties. They both suck.  The rules say “NO US or THEM BULLSHIT.” WHY IS IT SO HARD TO BELIEVE.??Democrats getting on here to bombard people with a different opinion?? Of course they want to walk away. Who wants to be around that crap.
sublimei Я, как бывший демократ, очень с удовольствием присоединяюсь к товарищу Трампу. Он очень рад. Очень здорово. Рад оставить демократов и присоединиться к республиканцам. Кто со мной? Кадетские костяные шпоры
KrinkleDoss Russians not really known for their sense of humor, I guess. Transparent and widely reported. Probably do more harm than good, Tovarisch. I thought this would at least be funny
Tankdaddy The hypocrisy, stubbornness, and hostility has finally gotten to me. The constant stream of the lies and manipulation from the media is just too much. I just feel so angry all the time at differing opinions. 

I was always taught to stand up for those that need help and to do the right thing no matter what. In the end, it's not my fault they moved away from me and my American values. I'm about truth, justice, and the American way.

The Twitter trends and the totally genuine FB wall posts about others, changed my mind. Two days ago, for no particular reason,  I decided to go for a little walk. So I walked to the end of the road. And when I got there, I thought maybe I'd walk to the end of town.  And when I got there, I thought maybe I'd just walk across the county. For no particular reason I have just kept on going. 

I've become so focused on walking away, I forgot why I originally started walking, but figure, I'll remember eventually. I'm Walking Away
BadBoyRuleBreaker69 Despite what liberal media claims, I love my country!

Every morning I wake up I am glad to be American.

Sure, things have been tough down here. But sometimes things are hard. 

Puerto Rico is my home.

America is MY country. 

Can I say it? Donald Trump...

Is MY PRESIDENT!

Thank you all for your bravery, patriots!

On our way to a second term!

2 TERM PRESIDENT!!! Walking away - Greetings from Puerto Rico!
DesperadoGW Run Don't Walk RDW
NotFallingInTheTrap I'm a conservative and have always been, and I'm here to support and encourage liberals and democrats to join this movement. The democratic party has become an extremist party that only cares for its own interests, I may not support liberal ideas, but you bet I would do anything so that REAL liberals can express themselves and have free speech. Not everyone in this movement is a bot, as they want us to believe, don't keep believing their bullshit! that's the reason you're walking away!        #NotABot
parkdisbus1 I used to be an active member of the Democratic Party and even canvassed for them on many occasions. However, after it became clear that they were letting terrorists, rapists, and thugs through the borders unchecked I simply couldn't remain. WE NEED STRONG BORDERS! While I didn't like him at first, President Trump has proved himself to be one of, if not the most, successful presidents of all time! I walked away
dorothy_zbornak_esq Walkaway is a hilarious bunch of crap and anyone who fell for it is dumb af lolol Is this making fun of #walkaway or for it?
MediumYachty There has been too much violence, too much pain. None here are without sin, but I have an honorable compromise. Just walk away. Leave the pump, the oil, the gasoline, and the whole compound, and I spare your lives. Just walk away. I will give you safe passage in the wasteland. Just walk away and there will be an end to the horror. I await your answer. You have one full day to decide. Just walk away
HubertusCatus88 This whole sub seems to be blatant attempt to suppress democratic voter turnout. Republicans, and thus Trump, are the clearest beneficiaries of such an action.  Who Benefits?
-Hadrian- hey i am presidnt of dmocraft nation party and al leftis ar dum sjw so i leev now bye bye resigning as presdent of democrts tomoz
RMFN I walked away in '16 when the party abandoned Bernie foe Wall Street. The party of progress isn't the democrats anymore.. Was it ever? When the left runs out of things to deconstruct they self destruct.
BadCapitalist HAIL PUTIN!  UP VOTE IF YOU ARE A NOT A RUSSIAN BOT OR DISINFORMATION AGENT!
tenderlogna That's how Looney liberals sound right now. Illegal aliens are more important than poor people in America. They deserve all of our money. Fuck poor America. Fuck the veterans. Fuck the homeless. Give them jobs and houses instead of people born here.
EwwieImp Stop spreading your bullshit with this #Walkaway idiocy. #Wakeup
I_Feared_4_My_Life Я неудачная сука и не хочу, чтобы женщины играли в видеоигры. Вы лучше послушайте меня, или я стану нацистом. Клянусь. Мы должны обеспечить этику в игровой журналистике.
ERRORCORRECTBOT I still consider myself a classical liberal even though I bash neo-liberal/leftists types all day. It's just really easy. They could make it more difficult by being good, tolerant, open minded people- but they wont because in the depths of their delusion they actually believe they are good and tolerant. They can maintain that believe while simultaneously saying evil, intolerant things to someone. It is almost impressive how thoroughly destroyed a mind can become when it adapts to become comfortable with a state of constant cognitive dissonance. 

I used to be an ignorant pro socialism, anti rights (2A, 1A, solely to hurt republicans), pro abortion, classist, success-hating, rule-hating, money-hating, self/white-hating, male-hating liberal idiot. 

If it wasnt for a few wise and patient people who never gave up on me, I would still be drowning in that pool of ignorance. Not all of us have people like that in our lives who are willing to put effort into saving you. Especially not when the liberal instinct is to be evil and intolerant and call them extreme names like Nazi and White Supremacist. No one wants to help a nasty piece of shit person and this is why so many liberals, who werent as lucky as me, are still that way.

To any democrat who thinks Im a bot: you are an idiot. You are comically stupid. People like you are at the heart of a burgeoning stereotype of a liberals so extremely lacking in self awareness that it is practically a mental disability. I really pity you because perspective is EVERYTHING. Perspective is the gate to the world. To see people with such a shriveled, closed gate with such busted up hinges- it's sad. You deserve to exist in reality with the rest of us. It is wrong what your moderators, "leaders", msm propagandists etc are doing to you. You ARE a victim... but you've misidentified the offender. All I do is talk shit. It bounces right off. The people with the keya to your heart and mind are the sources you THINK you can trust, and THEY are mentally abusing people like you. It is sick. You have all this anger holed up a d you are told to give it to Trump, and to me, but it is the people who implant those orders who deserve to receive it. 

Good luck. Lastly, please consider reading Sowell's Basic Economics, it helps a lot. If you are young and/or new to politics (aka you think Im a nazi and Trump is a dictator) then Bill Whittle's What We Believe and Firewall vids are a good place to start, as they keep in mind the fact that you are probably either very naive or an institutional mental abuse victim.

Thank you for your time. Walked away early 2016 - and became a meaniepants
NorthwesterlyHog I am 44, and all but once I have voted for a D.  I didn't this time.  Why?

Well, there used to be a time when you knew you weren't voting for a warmonger if you voted D, but that's not so anymore.  

Also, the Ds claim to care about the little guy, but more and more it seems they just care about putting money in big business (I know, I know, same with the R's).  Bill Clinton said NAFTA was going to be the best thing since sliced bread, but really it just helped big business.  I mean sure, the price of cars went down, but the middle class jobs that went with making cars went away.  Was it really a good trade off?  And then Obama said he was going to give everyone single payer healthcare, but that didn't work out so well did it?  Instead he just mandated that the middle class give money hand over fist to big pharma and the medical industry.  And it started to seem like when the D's help the little guy, it's actually out of the middle classes pocket, not big business or the 1&amp;#37;.

And I think their current position on immigration is the same way.  They claim it's for the humanity of it all, but really they want illegal immigrants so the big businesses can have dirt cheap labor.  I used to live in a town with a meat processing plant.  It opened about ten years ago, and over the past decade you can absolutely see the changes it has caused in the town.  They call the area near the plant "Little Mexico", and that entire area is like living in a different country.  Which isn't to say that Latino culture is "bad".  I go to Mexico frequently and absolutely love it.  But to see Latino culture take over your small town is sad.  So I white-flighted it the hell out of that town.  But I don't think you can even call it white flight anymore, because my black neighbors were moving also.

And that's another thing.  The plants in that town used to be staffed with low income whites and blacks.  Now it's all illegal immigrants.  And the argument that Americans won't do the work is a total cop out.  It's that we've done away with the unions, so now those jobs are shitty, with no benefits, don't pay well, and dangerous.  So no, Americans don't want to work in a pork processing plant for $12 an hour.  

And then comes the drugs.  Gangs and crime are out of control.  A woman was shot in a drive by while holding her child in the town I lived in.  Shit like that didn't happen 15 years ago.  And now shootings are a common occurrence.  And everyone is on drugs.

So here we are, the middle of the country is dying, and Obama is talking about how successful his presidency was.  That was pretty off-putting.  I'm sure it was very success for the coasts, and Europe.  But he all but ignored the middle of the US, and now that we're demanding attention the Ds are shaming and insulting us.

But then the reaction after the election was what really shocked me.  And like I said, I'm old.  I voted for Gore and I remember when Bush won after like three days  with a hanging chad in Florida.  Everyone was upset, but we didn't turn on each other like rabid animals who were all hopped up on a mixture of facebook and DNC super pac  moral outrage.  This out of control rage is encouraged, and even driven by the Ds, and it's ugly.  And yes, I remember all the hate Obama got, and I thought that was ugly too.  But I also remember anytime you disagreeded with Obama you were called a racist.  "Well, I've been pretty disappointed with Obamacare.  We were supposed to get single payer, but that didn't happen."  "Fucking racist."

And now, Ds are shaming those who wrote in Bernie.  Claiming they should have sucked it up and voted for Hillary.  So, the D's new position is, even if we cheat our primaries, and put in a unpopular candidate, refused to listen to issues that matter to you, you HAVE to vote for us.  If you look at the most downvoted post in the history of the politics sub, you'll see it's about voting for Hillary now that Bernie dropped out.  People hated that attitude just a year ago, but suddenly now it's supposed to be the prevailing opinion with all the Ds?  Vote for us no matter who we put up.  Goooooo Team!

Which leads me to my final point.  All this crying about Russian bots, but it seems to me that the DNC has astroturfed the shit out of the place.  I mean, don't get me wrong, maybe the three day old account that does nothing but troll this sub is legit.  But I'm skeptical.

So, while I didn't "walk away", I did stop drinking the kool-aid.  The D's don't care about minorities or the oppressed, or those in need any more than the R's do.  They just pander to them for votes while the Rs pander to the middle class, but both of them service one lord and master - big business.  Wall Street.  The 1&amp;#37;.  And make no mistake, middle class in America is just as oppressed as the "poor".  We both have basically the same shit, I just pay out of pocket for mine, or it might be a little nicer version, but I'm not living in high cotton either.  I have money concerns just like the poor do.

So, no I won't vote D because of fear mongering, shaming, scare tactics, or empty promises.  Obama burned that bridge. I won't say I've "walked away", but I did vote R in the last election for the first time ever.

mister_accismus A. What Does "Freedom of Criticism" Mean?

"Freedom of criticism" is undoubtedly the most fashionable slogan at the present time, and the one most frequently employed in the controversies between socialists and democrats in all countries. At first sight, nothing would appear to be more strange than the solemn appeals to freedom of criticism made by one of the parties to the dispute. Have voices been raised in the advanced parties against the constitutional law of the majority of European countries which guarantees freedom to science and scientific investigation? "Something must be wrong here" will be the comment of the onlooker who has heard this fashionable slogan repeated at every turn but has not yet penetrated the essence of the disagreement among the disputants; evidently this slogan is one of the conventional phrases which, like nicknames, become legitimised by use, and become almost generic terms.

In fact, it is no secret for anyone that two trends have taken form in present-day international Social-Democracy. The conflict between these trends now flares up in a bright flame and now dies down and smoulders under the ashes of imposing "truce resolutions". The essence of the "new" trend, which adopts a "critical" attitude towards "obsolete dogmatic" Marxism, has been clearly enough presented by Bernstein and demonstrated by Millerand.

Social-Democracy must change from a party of social revolution into a democratic party of social reforms. Bernstein has surrounded this political demand with a whole battery of well-attuned "new" arguments and reasonings. Denied was the possibility of putting socialism on a scientific basis and of demonstrating its necessity and inevitability from the point of view of the materialist conception of history. Denied was the fact of growing impoverishment, the process of proletarisation, and the intensification of capitalist contradictions; the very concept, "ultimate aim", was declared to be unsound, and the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat was completely rejected. Denied was the antithesis in principle between liberalism and socialism. Denied was the theory of the class struggle, on the alleged grounds that it could not be applied to a strictly democratic society governed according to the will of the majority, etc.

Thus, the demand for a decisive turn from revolutionary Social-Democracy to bourgeois social-reformism was accompanied by a no less decisive turn towards bourgeois criticism of all the fundamental ideas of Marxism. In view of the fact that this criticism of Marxism has long been directed from the political platform, from university chairs, in numerous pamphlets and in a series of learned treatises, in view of the fact that the entire younger generation of the educated classes has been systematically reared for decades on this criticism, it is not surprising that the "new critical" trend in Social-Democracy should spring up, all complete, like Minerva from the head of Jove. The content of this new trend did not have to grow and take shape, it was transferred bodily from bourgeois to socialist literature.

To proceed. If Bernstein’s theoretical criticism and political yearnings were still unclear to anyone, the French took the trouble strikingly to demonstrate the "new method". In this instance, too, France has justified its old reputation of being "the land where, more than anywhere else, the historical class struggles were each time fought out to a decision..." (Engels, Introduction to Marx’s Der 18 Brumaire). The French socialists have begun, not to theorise, but to act. The democratically more highly developed political conditions in France have permitted them to put "Bernsteinism into practice" immediately, with all its consequences. Millerand has furnished an excellent example of practical Bernsteinism; not without reason did Bernstein and Vollmar rush so zealously to defend and laud him. Indeed, if Social-Democracy, in essence, is merely a party of reform and must be bold enough to admit this openly, then not only has a socialist the right to join a bourgeois cabinet, but he must always strive to do so. If democracy, in essence, means the abolition of class domination, then why should not a socialist minister charm the whole bourgeois world by orations on class collaboration? Why should he not remain in the cabinet even after the shooting-down of workers by gendarmes has exposed, for the hundredth and thousandth time, the real nature of the democratic collaboration of classes? Why should he not personally take part in greeting the tsar, for whom the French socialists now have no other name than hero of the gallows, knout, and exile (*knouteur, pendeur et deportateur*)? And the reward for this utter humiliation and self-degradation of socialism in the face of the whole world, for the corruption of the socialist consciousness of the working masses — the only basis that can guarantee our victory — the reward for this is pompous projects for miserable reforms, so miserable in fact that much more has been obtained from bourgeois governments!

He who does not deliberately close his eyes cannot fail to see that the new "critical" trend in socialism is nothing more nor less than a new variety of opportunism. And if we judge people, not by the glittering uniforms they don or by the highsounding appellations they give themselves, but by their actions and by what they actually advocate, it will be clear that "freedom of criticism" means freedom for an opportunist trend in Social-Democracy, freedom to convert Social-Democracy into a democratic party of reform, freedom to introduce bourgeois ideas and bourgeois elements into socialism.

"Freedom" is a grand word, but under the banner of freedom for industry the most predatory wars were waged, under the banner of freedom of labour, the working people were robbed. The modern use of the term "freedom of criticism" contains the same inherent falsehood. Those who are really convinced that they have made progress in science would not demand freedom for the new views to continue side by side with the old, but the substitution of the new views for the old. The cry heard today, "Long live freedom of criticism", is too strongly reminiscent of the fable of the empty barrel.

We are marching in a compact group along a precipitous and difficult path, firmly holding each other by the hand. We are surrounded on all sides by enemies, and we have to advance almost constantly under their fire. We have combined, by a freely adopted decision, for the purpose of fighting the enemy, and not of retreating into the neighbouring marsh, the inhabitants of which, from the very outset, have reproached us with having separated ourselves into an exclusive group and with having chosen the path of struggle instead of the path of conciliation. And now some among us begin to cry out: Let us go into the marsh! And when we begin to shame them, they retort: What backward people you are! Are you not ashamed to deny us the liberty to invite you to take a better road! Oh, yes, gentlemen! You are free not only to invite us, but to go yourselves wherever you will, even into the marsh. In fact, we think that the marsh is your proper place, and we are prepared to render you every assistance to get there. Only let go of our hands, don’t clutch at us and don’t besmirch the grand word freedom, for we too are "free" to go where we please, free to fight not only against the marsh, but also against those who are turning towards the marsh!

mister_accismus B. The New Advocates of "Freedom of Criticism"

Now, this slogan ("freedom of criticism") has in recent times been solemnly advanced by *Rabocheye Dyelo* (No. 10), organ of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, not as a theoretical postulate, but as a political demand, as a reply to the question, "Is it possible to unite the Social-Democratic organisations operating abroad?": "For a durable unity, there must be freedom of criticism" (p. 36).

From this statement two definite conclusions follow: (1) that *Rabocheye Dyelo* has taken under its wing the opportunist trend in international Social-Democracy in general, and (2) that *Rabocheye Dyelo* demands freedom for opportunism in Russian Social-Democracy. Let us examine these conclusions.

*Rabocheye Dyelo* is "particularly" displeased with the "inclination of *Iskra* and *Zarya* to predict a rupture between the *Mountain* and the *Gironde* in international Social-Democracy".

&gt; Generally speaking, writes B. Krichevsky, editor of *Rabocheye Dyelo,* "this talk of the *Mountain* and the *Gironde* heard in the ranks of Social-Democracy represents a shallow historical analogy, a strange thing to come from the pen of a Marxist. The *Mountain* and the *Gironde* did not represent different temperaments, or intellectual trends, as the historians of social thought may think, but different classes or strata — the middle bourgeoisie, on the one hand, and the petty bourgeoisie and the proletariat, on the other. In the modern socialist movement, however, there is no conflict of class interests; the socialist movement in its entirety, in *all* of its diverse forms (Krichevsky’s italics), including the most pronounced Bernsteinians, stands on the basis of the class interests of the proletariat and its class struggle for political and economic emancipation" (pp. 32-33).

A bold assertion! Has not Krichevsky heard of the fact, long ago noted, that it is precisely the extensive participation of an "academic" stratum in the socialist movement in recent years that has promoted such a rapid spread of Bernsteinism? And what is most important — on what does our author found his opinion that even "the most pronounced Bernsteinians" stand on the basis of the class struggle for the political and economic emancipation of the proletariat? No one knows. This determined defence of the most pronounced Bernsteinians is not supported by any argument or reasoning whatever. Apparently, the author believes that if he repeats what the most pronounced Bernsteinians say about themselves his assertion requires no proof. But can anything more "shallow" be imagined than this judgement of an entire trend based on nothing more than what the representatives of that trend say about themselves? Can anything more shallow be imagined than the subsequent "homily" on the two different and even diametrically opposite types, or paths, of party development? (*Rabocheye Dyelo,* pp. 34-35.) The German Social-Democrats, in other words, recognise complete freedom of criticism, but the French do not, and it is precisely their example that demonstrates the "bane of intolerance".

To this we can only say that the very example B. Krichevsky affords us attests to the fact that the name Marxists is at times assumed by people who conceive history literally in the "Ilovaisky manner". To explain the unity of the German Socialist Party and the disunity of the French Socialist Party, there is no need whatever to go into the special features in the history of these countries, to contrast the conditions of military semiabsolutism in the one with republican parliamentarism in the other, to analyse the effects of the Paris Commune and the effects of the Exceptional Law Against the Socialists, to compare the economic life and economic development of the two countries, or to recall that "the unexampled growth of German Social-Democracy" was accompanied by a strenuous struggle, unique in the history of socialism, not only against erroneous theories (Mühlberger, Dühring, the Katheder-Socialists), but also against erroneous tactics (Lassalle), etc., etc. All that is superfluous! The French quarrel among themselves because they are intolerant; the Germans are united because they are good boys.

And observe, this piece of matchless profundity is designed to "refute" the fact that puts to rout the defence of the Bernsteinians. The question whether or not the Bernsteinians stand on the basis of the class struggle of the proletariat is one that can be completely and irrevocably answered only by historical experience. Consequently, the example of France holds greatest significance in this respect, because France is the only country in which the Bernsteinians attempted to stand independently, on their own feet, with the warm approval of their German colleagues (and partly also of the Russian opportunists; cf. *Rabocheye Dyelo,* No. 2-3, pp. 83-84). The reference to the "intolerance" of the French, apart from its "historical" significance (in the Nozdryov sense), turns out to be merely an attempt to hush up very unpleasant facts with angry invectives.

Nor are we inclined to make a present of the Germans to Krichevsky and the numerous other champions of "freedom of criticism". If the "most pronounced Bernsteinians" are still tolerated in the ranks of the German party, it is only to the extent that they submit to the Hanover resolution, which emphatically rejected Bernstein’s "amendments", and to the Lubeck resolution, which (notwithstanding the diplomatic terms in which it is couched) contains a direct warning to Bernstein. It is debatable, from the standpoint of the interests of the German party, whether diplomacy was appropriate and whether, in this case, a bad peace is better than a good quarrel; in short, opinions may differ as to the expediency of any one of the methods employed to reject Bernsteinism, but that the German party did reject Bernsteinism on two occasions, is a fact no one can fail to see. Therefore, to think that the German example confirms the thesis that "the most pronounced Bernsteinians stand on the basis of the class struggle of the proletariat, for political and economic emancipation", means to fail completely to understand what is going on under our very eyes.

Nor is that all. As we have seen, *Rabocheye Dyelo* demands "freedom of criticism" and defends Bernsteinism before Russian Social-Democracy. Apparently it convinced itself that we were unfair to our "Critics" and Bernsteinians. But to which ones? who? where? when? What did the unfairness represent? About this, not a word. *Rabocheye Dyelo* does not name a single Russian Critic or Bernsteinian! We are left with but one of two possible suppositions. Either the unfairly treated party is none other than *Rabocheye Dyelo* itself (this is confirmed by the fact that in the two articles in No. 10 reference is made only to the wrongs suffered by *Rabocheye Dyelo* at the hands of *Zarya* and *Iskra*). If that is the case, how is the strange fact to be explained that *Rabocheye Dyelo,* which always vehemently dissociated itself from all solidarity with Bernsteinism, could not defend itself without putting in a word in defence of the "most pronounced Bernsteinians" and of freedom of criticism? Or some third persons have been treated unfairly. if this is the case, then what reasons may there be for not naming them?

We see, therefore, that *Rabocheye Dyelo* is continuing to play the game of hide-and-seek it has played (as we shall show below) ever since its founding. And let us note further this first practical application of the vaunted "freedom of criticism". In actual fact, not only was it forthwith reduced to abstention from all criticism, but also to abstention from expressing independent views altogether. The very *Rabocheye Dyelo,* which avoids mentioning Russian Bernsteinism as if it were a shameful disease (to use Starover's apt expression), proposes, for the treatment of this disease, to copy word for word the latest German prescription for the German variety of the malady! Instead of freedom of criticism slavish (worse: apish) imitation! The very same social and political content of modern international opportunism reveals itself in a variety of ways according to national peculiarities. In one country the opportunists have long ago come out under a separate flag; in another, they have ignored theory and in fact pursued the policy of the Radicals-Socialists; in a third, some members of the revolutionary party have deserted to the camp of opportunism and strive to achieve their aims, not in open struggle for principles and for new tactics, but by gradual, imperceptible, and, if one may so put it, unpunishable corruption of their party; in a fourth country, similar deserters employ the same methods in the gloom of political slavery, and with a completely original combination of "legal" and "illegal" activity, etc. To talk of freedom of criticism and of Bernsteinism as a condition for uniting the Russian Social Democrats and not to explain how Russian Bernsteinism has manifested itself and what particular fruits it has borne, amounts to talking with the aim of saying nothing.

Let us ourselves try, if only in a few words, to say what *Rabocheye Dyelo* did not want to say (or which was, perhaps, beyond its comprehension). Dogmatism and "Freedom of Criticism" (cont.)

mister_accismus C. Criticism in Russia [ed. note—here's the good stuff!]

The chief distinguishing feature of Russia in regard to the point we are examining is that the very beginning of the spontaneous working-class movement, on the one hand, and of the turn of progressive public opinion towards Marxism, on the other, was marked by the combination of manifestly heterogeneous elements under a common flag to fight the common enemy (the obsolete social and political world outlook). We refer to the heyday of "legal Marxism". Speaking generally, this was an altogether curious phenomenon that no one in the eighties or the beginning of the nineties would have believed possible. In a country ruled by an autocracy, with a completely enslaved press, in a period of desperate political reaction in which even the tiniest outgrowth of political discontent and protest is persecuted, the theory of revolutionary Marxism suddenly forces its way into the censored literature and, though expounded in Aesopian language, is understood by all the "interested". The government had accustomed itself to regarding only the theory of the (revolutionary) Narodnaya Volya [you guys recognize this one, right?—ed.] as dangerous, without, as is usual, observing its internal evolution, and rejoicing at any criticism levelled against it. Quite a considerable time elapsed (by our Russian standards) before the government realised what had happened and the unwieldy army of censors and gendarmes discovered the new enemy and flung itself upon him. Meanwhile, Marxist books were published one after another, Marxist journals and newspapers were founded, nearly everyone became a Marxist, Marxists were flattered, Marxists were courted, and the book publishers rejoiced at the extraordinary, ready sale of Marxist literature. It was quite natural, therefore, that among the Marxian neophytes who were caught up in this atmosphere, there should be more than one "author who got a swelled head..."

We can now speak calmly of this period as of an event of the past. It is no secret that the brief period in which Marxism blossomed on the surface of our literature was called forth by an alliance between people of extreme and of very moderate views. In point of fact, the latter were bourgeois democrats; this conclusion (so markedly confirmed by their subsequent "critical" development) suggested itself to some even when the "alliance" was still intact.

That being the case, are not the revolutionary Social-Democrats who entered into the alliance with the future "Critics" mainly responsible for the subsequent "confusion"? This question, together with a reply in the affirmative, is sometimes heard from people with too rigid a view. But such people are entirely in the wrong. Only those who are not sure of themselves can fear to enter into temporary alliances even with unreliable people; not a single political party could exist without such alliances. The combination with the legal Marxists was in its way the first really political alliance entered into by Russian Social-Democrats. Thanks to this alliance, an astonishingly rapid victory was obtained over Narodism, and Marxist ideas (even though in a vulgarised form) became very widespread. Moreover, the alliance was not concluded altogether without "conditions". Evidence of this is the burning by the censor, in 1895, of the Marxist collection Material on the Question of the Economic Development of Russia. If the literary agreement with the legal Marxists can be compared with a political alliance, then that book can be compared with a political treaty.

The rupture, of course, did not occur because the "allies" proved to be bourgeois democrats. On the contrary, the representatives of the latter trend are natural and desirable allies of Social-Democracy insofar as its democratic tasks, brought to the fore by the prevailing situation in Russia, are concerned. But an essential condition for such an alliance must be the full opportunity for the socialists to reveal to the working class that its interests are diametrically opposed to the interests of the bourgeoisie. However, the Bernsteinian and "critical" trend, to which the majority of the legal Marxists turned, deprived the socialists of this opportunity and demoralised the socialist consciousness by vulgarising Marxism, by advocating the theory of the blunting of social contradictions, by declaring the idea of the social revolution and of the dictatorship of the proletariat to be absurd, by reducing the working-class movement and the class struggle to narrow trade-unionism and to a "realistic" struggle for petty, gradual reforms. This was synonymous with bourgeois democracy’s denial of socialism’s right to independence and, consequently, of its right to existence; in practice it meant a striving to convert the nascent working-class movement into an appendage of the liberals.

Naturally, under such circumstances the rupture was necessary. But the "peculiar" feature of Russia manifested itself in the fact that this rupture simply meant the elimination of the Social-Democrats from the most accessible and widespread "legal" literature. The "ex-Marxists", who took up the flag of "criticism" and who obtained almost a monopoly to demolish Marxism, entrenched themselves in this literature. Catchwords like "Against orthodoxy" and "Long live freedom of criticism" (now repeated by *Rabocheye Dyelo*) forthwith became the vogue, and the fact that neither the censor nor the gendarmes could resist this vogue is apparent from the publication of three Russian editions of the work of the celebrated Bernstein (celebrated in the Herostratean sense) and from the fact that the works of Bernstein, Mr. Prokopovich, and others were recommended by Zubatov (*Iskra,* No. 10). A task now devolved upon the Social Democrats that was difficult in itself and was made incredibly more difficult by purely external obstacles — the task of combating the new trend. This trend did not confine itself to the sphere of literature. The turn towards "criticism" was accompanied by an infatuation for Economism among Social-Democratic practical workers.

The manner in which the connection between, and interdependence of, legal criticism and illegal Economism arose and grew is in itself an interesting subject, one that could serve as the theme of a special article. We need only note here that this connection undoubtedly existed. The notoriety deservedly acquired by the *Credo* was due precisely to the frankness with which it formulated this connection and blurted out the fundamental political tendency of Economism — let the workers carry on the economic struggle (it would be more correct to say the trade unionist struggle, because the latter also embraces specifically working class politics) and let the Marxist intelligentsia merge with the liberals for the political "struggle." Thus, trade-unionist work "among the people" meant fulfilling the first part of this task, while legal criticism meant fulfilling the second. This statement was such an excellent weapon against Economism that, had there been no *Credo,* it would have been worth inventing one.

The *Credo* was not invented, but it was published without the consent and perhaps even against the will of its authors. At all events, the present writer, who took part in dragging this new "programme" into the light of day, has heard complaints and reproaches to the effect that copies of the resume of the speakers’ views were distributed, dubbed the *Credo,* and even published in the press together with the protest! We refer to this episode because it reveals a very peculiar feature of our Economism — fear of publicity. This is a feature of Economism generally, and not of the authors of the *Credo* alone. It was revealed by that most outspoken and honest advocate of Economism, *Rabochaya Mysl,* and by *Rabocheye Dyelo* (which was indignant over the publication of "Economist" documents in the Vademecum), as well as by the Kiev Committee, which two years ago refused to permit the publication of its *profession de foi,* together with a repudiation of it, and by many other individual representatives of Economism.

This fear of criticism displayed by the advocates of freedom of criticism cannot be attributed solely to craftiness (although, on occasion, no doubt craftiness is brought into play: it would be improvident to expose the young and as yet frail shoots of the new trend. to attacks by opponents). No, the majority of the Economists look with sincere resentment (as by the very nature of Economism they must) upon all theoretical controversies, factional disagreements, broad political questions, plans for organising revolutionaries, etc. "Leave all that to the people abroad!" said a fairly consistent Economist to me one day, thereby expressing a very widespread (and again purely trade-unionist) view; our concern is the working-class movement, the workers, organisations here, in our localities; all the rest is merely the invention of doctrinaires, "the overrating of ideology", as the authors of the letter, published in *Iskra,* No. 12, expressed it, in unison with *Rabocheye Dyelo,* No. 10.

The question now arises: such being the peculiar features of Russian "criticism" and Russian Bernsteinism, what should have been the task of those who sought to oppose opportunism in deeds and not merely in words? First, they should have made efforts to resume the theoretical work that had barely begun in the period of legal Marxism and that fell anew on the shoulders of the comrades working underground. Without such work the successful growth of the movement was impossible. Secondly, they should have actively combated the legal "criticism" that was perverting people’s minds on a considerable scale. Thirdly, they should have actively opposed confusion and vacillation in the practical movement, exposing and repudiating every conscious or unconscious attempt to degrade our programme and our tactics.

That *Rabocheye Dyelo* did none of these things is well known; we shall have occasion below to deal with this well-known fact in detail and from various aspects. At the moment, however, we desire merely to show the glaring contradiction that exists between the demand for "freedom of criticism" and the specific features of our native criticism and Russian Economism. It suffices but to glance at the text of the resolution in which the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad endorsed the point of view of *Rabocheye Dyelo.*

&gt; In the interests of the further ideological development of Social-Democracy, we recognise the freedom of criticism of Social-Democratic theory in Party literature to be absolutely necessary insofar as the criticism does not run counter to the class and revolutionary character of this theory (*Two Conferences,* p. 10).

And the motivation? The resolution "in its first part coincides with the resolution of the Lubeck Party Congress on Bernstein". In the simplicity of their souls the "Unionists" failed to observe what a *testimonium paupertatis* (attestation of poverty) they betray with this copying. "But ... in its second part, it restricts freedom of criticism much more than did the Lubeck Party Congress."

The resolution of the Union Abroad, then, is directed against the Russian Bernsteinians? If it is not, then the reference to Lubeck would be utterly absurd. But it is not true to say that it "restricts freedom of criticism". In adopting their Hanover resolution, the Germans, point by point, rejected precisely the amendments proposed by Bernstein, while in their Lubeck resolution they cautioned Bernstein personally, by naming him. Our "free" imitators, however, make not a single allusion to a single manifestation of specifically Russian "criticism" and Russian Economism. In view of this omission, the bare reference to the class and revolutionary character of the theory leaves far wider scope for misinterpretation, particularly when the Union Abroad refuses to identify "so-called Economism" with opportunism (*Two Conferences,* p. 8, Paragraph 1). But all this, in passing. The main thing to note is that the positions of the opportunists in relation to the revolutionary Social-Democrats in Russia are diametrically opposed to those in Germany. In that country, as we know, the revolutionary Social-Democrats are in favour of preserving that which exists — the old programme and the tactics, which are universally known and have been elucidated in all their details by many decades of experience. But the "Critics" desire to introduce changes, and since these Critics represent an insignificant minority, and since they are very timid in their revisionist efforts, one can understand the motives of the majority in confining themselves to the dry rejection of "innovations". In Russia, however, it is the Critics and the Economists who are in favour of preserving that which exists: the "Critics" want us to go on regarding them as Marxists and to guarantee them the "freedom of criticism" they enjoyed to the full (for, in fact, they never recognised any kind of party ties and, moreover, we never had a generally recognised party body that could "restrict" freedom of criticism, if only by counsel); the Economists want the revolutionaries to recognise the sovereign character of the present movement" (*Rabocheye Dyelo,* No. 10, p. 25), i.e., to recognise the "legitimacy" of that which exists; they want the "ideologists" not to try to "divert" the movement from the path that "is determined by the interaction of material. elements and material environment" ("Letter" in *Iskra,* No. 12); they want to have that struggle recognised as desirable "which it is possible for the workers to wage under the present conditions", and as the only possible struggle, that "which they are actually waging at the present time" ("Separate Supplement" to *Rabochaya Mysl,* p. 14). We revolutionary Social-Democrats, on the contrary, are dissatisfied with this worship of spontaneity, i.e., of that which exists "at the present moment". **We demand that the tactics that have prevailed in recent years be changed; we declare that "before we can unite, and in order that we may unite, we must first of all draw firm and definite lines of demarcation"** [emphasis mine—ed.] (see announcement of the publication of *Iskra*). In a word, the Germans stand for that which exists and reject changes; we demand a change of that which exists, and reject subservience thereto and reconciliation to it.

This "slight" difference our "free" copyists of German resolutions failed to notice. Dogmatism and "Freedom of Criticism" (cont.)

mister_accismus D. Engels On the Importance of the Theoretical Struggle

"Dogmatism, doctrinairism", "ossification of the party — the inevitable retribution that follows the violent strait-lacing of thought" — these are the enemies against which the knightly champions of "freedom of criticism" in *Rabocheye Dyelo* rise up in arms. We are very glad that this question has been placed on the order of the day and we would only propose to add to it one other:

And who are the judges?

We have before us two publishers’ announcements. One, "The Programme of the Periodical Organ of the Union of Russian Social Democrats Abroad — *Rabocheye Dyelo*" (reprint from No. 1 of *Rabocheye Dyelo*), and the other, the "Announcement of the Resumption of the Publications of the Emancipation of Labour Group". Both are dated 1899, when the "crisis of Marxism" had long been under discussion. And what do we find? We would seek in vain in the first announcement for any reference to this phenomenon, or a definite statement of the position the new organ intends to adopt on this question. Not a word is said about theoretical work and the urgent tasks that now confront it, either in this programme or in the supplements to it that were adopted by the Third Congress of the Union Abroad in 1901 (*Two Conferences,* pp. 15-18). During this entire time the Editorial Board of *Rabocheye Dyelo* ignored theoretical questions, in spite of the fact that these were questions that disturbed the minds of all Social-Democrats the world over.

The other announcement, on the contrary, points first of all to the declining interest in theory in recent years, imperatively demands "vigilant attention to the theoretical aspect of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat", and calls for "ruthless criticism of the Bernsteinian and other anti-revolutionary tendencies" in our movement. The issues of *Zarya* to date show how this programme has been carried out.

Thus, we see that high-sounding phrases against the ossification of thought, etc., conceal unconcern and helplessness with regard to the development of theoretical thought. The case of the Russian Social-Democrats manifestly illustrates the general European phenomenon (long ago noted also by the German Marxists) that the much vaunted freedom of criticism does not imply substitution of one theory for another, but freedom from all integral and pondered theory; it implies eclecticism and lack of principle. Those who have the slightest acquaintance with the actual state of our movement cannot but see that the wide spread of Marxism was accompanied by a certain lowering of the theoretical level. Quite a number of people with very little, and even a total lack of theoretical training joined the movement because of its practical significance and its practical successes. We can judge from that how tactless *Rabocheye Dyelo* is when, with an air of triumph, it quotes Marx’s statement: "Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes." To repeat these words in a period of theoretical disorder is like wishing mourners at a funeral many happy returns of the day. Moreover, these words of Marx are taken from his letter on the Gotha Programme, in which he sharply condemns eclecticism in the formulation of principles. **If you must unite, Marx wrote to the party leaders, then enter into agreements to satisfy the practical aims of the movement, but do not allow any bargaining over principles, do not make theoretical "concessions".** [emphasis mine—ed.] This was Marx’s idea, and yet there are people among us who seek, in his name, to belittle the significance of theory!

Without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement. This idea cannot be insisted upon too strongly at a time when the fashionable preaching of opportunism goes hand in hand with an infatuation for the narrowest forms of practical activity. Yet, for Russian Social-Democrats the importance of theory is enhanced by three other circumstances, which are often forgotten: first, by the fact that our Party is only in process of formation, its features are only just becoming defined, and it has as yet far from settled accounts with the other trends of revolutionary thought that threaten to divert the movement from the correct path. On the contrary, precisely the very recent past was marked by a revival of non-Social-Democratic revolutionary trends (an eventuation regarding which Axelrod long ago warned the Economists). Under these circumstances, what at first sight appears to be an "unimportant" error may lead to most deplorable consequences, and only short-sighted people can consider factional disputes and a strict differentiation between shades of opinion inopportune or superfluous. The fate of Russian Social-Democracy for very many years to come may depend on the strengthening of one or the other "shade".

Secondly, the Social-Democratic movement is in its very essence an international movement. This means, not only that we must combat national chauvinism, but that an incipient movement in a young country can be successful only if it makes use of the experiences of other countries. In order to make use of these experiences it is not enough merely to be acquainted with them, or simply to copy out the latest resolutions. What is required is the ability to treat these experiences critically and to test them independently. He who realises how enormously the modern working-class movement has grown and branched out will understand what a reserve of theoretical forces and political (as well as revolutionary) experience is required to carry out this task.

Thirdly, the national tasks of Russian Social-Democracy are such as have never confronted any other socialist party in the world. We shall have occasion further on to deal with the political and organisational duties which the task of emancipating the whole people from the yoke of autocracy imposes upon us. At this point, we wish to state only that the role of vanguard fighter can be fulfilled only by a party that is guided by the most advanced theory. To have a concrete understanding of what this means, let the reader recall such predecessors of Russian Social Democracy as Herzen, Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, and the brilliant galaxy of revolutionaries of the seventies; let him ponder over the world significance which Russian literature is now acquiring; let him — but be that enough!

Let us quote what Engels said in 1874 concerning the significance of theory in the Social-Democratic movement. Engels recognizes, not two forms of the great struggle of Social Democracy (political and economic), as is the fashion among us, but three, placing the theoretical struggle on a par with the first two. His recommendations to the German working-class movement, which had become strong, practically and politically, are so instructive from the standpoint of present-day problems and controversies, that we hope the reader will not be vexed with us for quoting a long passage from his prefatory note to *Der deutsche Bauernkrieg,* which has long become a great bibliographical rarity:

&gt; The German workers have two important advantages over those of the rest of Europe. First, they belong to the most theoretical people of Europe; and they have retained that sense of theory which the so-called "educated" classes of Germany have almost completely lost. Without German philosophy, which preceded it, particularly that of Hegel, German scientific socialism — the only scientific socialism that has ever existed — would never have come into being. Without a sense of theory among the workers, this scientific socialism would never have entered their flesh and blood as much as is the case. What an immeasurable advantage this is may be seen, on the one hand, from the indifference towards all theory, which is one of the main reasons why the English working-class movement crawls along so slowly in spite of the splendid organisation of the individual unions; on the other hand, from the mischief and confusion wrought by Proudhonism, in its original form, among the French and Belgians, and, in the form further caricatured by Bakunin, among the Spaniards and Italians.

&gt; The second advantage is that, chronologically speaking, the Germans were about the last to come into the workers’ movement. Just as German theoretical socialism will never forget that it rests on the shoulders of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen — three men who, in spite of all their fantastic notions and all their utopianism, have their place among the most eminent thinkers of all times, and whose genius anticipated innumerable things, the correctness of which is now being scientifically proved by us — so the practical workers’ movement in Germany ought never to forget that it has developed on the shoulders of the English and French movements, that it was able simply to utilise their dearly bought experience, and could now avoid their mistakes, which in their time were mostly unavoidable. Without the precedent of the English trade unions and French workers’ political struggles, without the gigantic impulse given especially by the Paris Commune, where would we be now?

&gt; It must be said to the credit of the German workers that they have exploited the advantages of their situation with rare understanding. For the first time since a workers’ movement has existed, the struggle is being conducted pursuant to its three sides — the theoretical, the political, and the practical-economic (resistance to the capitalists) — in harmony and in its interconnections, and in a systematic way. It is precisely in this, as it were, concentric attack, that the strength and invincibility of the German movement lies.

&gt; Due to this advantageous situation, on the one hand, and to the insular peculiarities of the English and the forcible suppression of the French movement, on the other, the German workers have for the moment been placed in the vanguard of the proletarian struggle. How long events will allow them to occupy this post of honour cannot be foretold. But let us hope that as long as they occupy it, they will fill it fittingly. This demands redoubled efforts in every field of struggle and agitation. In particular, it will be the duty of the leaders to gain an ever clearer insight into all theoretical questions, to free themselves more and more from the influence of traditional phrases inherited from the old world outlook, and constantly to keep in mind that socialism, since it has become a science, demands that it be pursued as a science, i.e., that it be studied. The task will be to spread with increased zeal among the masses of the workers the ever more clarified understanding thus acquired, to knit together ever more firmly the organisation both of the party and of the trade unions…

&gt; If the German workers progress in this way, they will not be marching exactly at the head of the movement — it is not at all in the interest of this movement that the workers of any particular country should march at its head — but they will occupy an honourable place in the battle line; and they will stand armed for battle when either unexpectedly grave trials or momentous events demand of them increased courage, increased determination and energy.

Engels’s words proved prophetic. Within a few years the German workers were subjected to unexpectedly grave trials in the form of the Exceptional Law Against the Socialists. And they met those trials armed for battle and succeeded in emerging from them victorious.

The Russian proletariat will have to undergo trials immeasurably graver; it will have to fight a monster compared with which an antisocialist law in a constitutional country seems but a dwarf. History has now confronted us with an immediate task which is the most revolutionary of all the immediate tasks confronting the proletariat of any country. The fulfilment of this task, the destruction of the most powerful bulwark, not only of European, but (it may now be said) of Asiatic reaction, would make the Russian proletariat the vanguard of the international revolutionary proletariat. And we have the right to count upon acquiring this honourable title, already earned by our predecessors, the revolutionaries of the seventies, if we succeed in inspiring our movement, which is a thousand times broader and deeper, with the same devoted determination and vigour. Dogmatism and "Freedom of Criticism" (cont., with misgivings)
Burn-Account Okay, I'm a liberal Democrat. So down vote me however much you want. But I'm not here to call you a bot, tell you your stupid, or troll. I have one very simple question.

Where are you walking away to?

I ask this because I agree with a lot the video talks about. Not all of it, but I do think he has some good points. I do believe the Democratic party has pushed away a lot of people in the center politically, and I do think they often have a desire to push drastic changes without taking the time to adiquately prepare and work towards those changes. I think some of our modern rhetoric is far too one sided and pushes an increasingly optimistic view of society/isn't realistic. 

So I have my issues with the party. I wasn't psyched about Clinton, though I voted for her. Neither was I a huge fan of Bernie, though again I still voted for him in the primary.

But what will keep me from walking away is the question of where I would walk away to. I find the modern rhetoric and leadership of the Republican party morally corrupt. Their policies continue to favor the extremely wealthy over all else, I find their religion-based social positions disgusting (LGBT rights are huge to me, as is gender/racial equality) and their economic policies, while on the surface seem reasonable (balenced budget, fiscal responsibility, etc), in practice are only used to benefit them (cuts to the financial support structure to justify increased military spending, war on drugs, etc). 

As for third parties, none seem to have a serious platform or any staying power (admittedly mostly because of how the system operates, at least to an extent).

So, I was wondering, to those who have walked away, or who are considering doing so, what is your alternative?

I don't, and won't, make that decision. But I do want to understand better this 'movement.' I'm a Liberal, but I'm not here to brigade. I simply have one question
take-to-the-streets Since I was a kid I’ve been a democrat. My parents are old school hippies and I grew up in a blue state (Nevada). When I was a teenager I campaigned for Richard Bryan’s re-election campaign. I didn’t actually think about my politics, beyond assuming that the democrats were good, and the republicans were bad. How could I think otherwise, the democrats were the guys who supported gay marriage (I’m bisexual) and the republicans were the racists (I’m mixed). How wrong I was. But I didn’t begin questioning these views until I was in college.

I entered college as an adult student, at the age of 28. I had previously worked for a construction company based out of Reno, but I fucked up my leg in a work accident and couldn’t work there anymore. My workers comp and savings were a considerable sum, so I decided to go to college and educate myself. I had always wanted to go to college but my high school grades weren’t great, so I gave up on that and worked instead. I managed to get myself into a middle of he pack college in Carson City, and got myself a scholarship for mature aged students. I decided to study agricultural science for the job opportunities, and minored in political science because I had begun to be interested in science. 

My agricultural science units were interesting, but what really started to interest me was the political science class. Apart from campaigning for Bryan (which I was basically forced into by my parents), I’d never been too politically inclined. But when I started learning in that class, i began to see how the world really worked, and the systems that kept everything moving. At that time I was a registered Democrat. One of the biggest things I noticed was the political inclinations of people in my class. STEM and political courses are some of the least “cucked” fields, but the ratio between democrats and republicans in my units was always at least 2:1. I began to question why that was. 

My second year in college came around the 2012 elections. I had previously supported obama, and I had loved him as a person at the time, but when I started educating myself I started to see the things the news didn’t tell you about obama. The scandals, the bombings, the gaffes. The previously pristine figure had been somewhat tarnished in my mind. I was still a democrat at the time, but I began to change. After the election (I voted obama), I began to be exhausted with college. I took a break for one half a year, but kept studying politics by myself. I began to look into why obama was so cherished by the media, and learnt about the powers behind him, that had supported so many presidents. Everything changed when I went back for my third year.

When I came back to college, I decided to join a political club. My college had banned partisan clubs, thanks to some fighting a few years back, but there were many big-tent political clubs to join. I joined one focused on modern economics and politics. A few weeks after joining the club and participating in a few debates (mostly with liberals about the things they didn’t like to confront), we got a notice that esteemed economist and philosopher Richard Wolff was coming to our college for a Q&amp;A. That was probably the day I learned the most in my life. Wolff reaffirmed many of the things I had begun questioning about liberals. The war crimes, the economic fucking of the poor, the subtle racism vs the republicans overt racism, he showed me the light. This turned me on a new course.

In the second half of the year I picked a course on Marxist economics as an elective. That was a huge half a year for me. I learnt almost everything I know today from that. I learnt how the American government (or other foreign powers) had engineered the downfall of almost every socialist state. How capitalists had Patrice Lumumba and Thomas Sankara assassinated. How neo-colonialism was raping Africa of its wealth. The powers of capitalism were not lifting people out of poverty as liberals like to say, they are keeping them in it. 

A few weeks ago I graduated college with a degree in chemical engineering, and I remembered my Democratic Party membership. I threw that away, and have joined the PSL (party for socialism and liberation). We have the resources to solve every issue in the world. Never let liberals tell you a better world isn’t possible. Walk away from the two bastions if capitalism in America and help unite the working class.  My #WalkAway (long)
Ambassador4TBI I was raised marxist, then evolved to a pretty conventional old school liberal mindset.

I voted Democrat, and ignored everything right of Dem as irrelevant to me.

Going into 2016 I wasn't paying much attention.

I liked Hillary in general, but felt she was too hawkish for me.

Years back I had an employee that had worked for Trump previously, and so I had heard some anecdotal stuff. Culturally the Pageants/WWF/Reality-TV were all abhorrent to me, but Trump had staunchly defended his employee's right to his sexuality, (gay black man) when somebody made an issue of it.

If it ended up as Hillary vs Trump, I would not vote and let Hillary take him down, but not have blood on my hands when she launched Libya-2.0 on some place full of brown people.

I had all the election stuff filtered out of my feed, and I intended to wait it out as a non participant.

Then I saw a news clip of gay people being chucked off of a rooftop for being gay.

I posted something to the effect that I felt our Dem Leaders should condemn such actions, and that we should demand they do. After all, my family is about a third LGBT, and activism has been a vigorous family tradition.

OMFG did I catch hell.

I was told that questioning our leadership at this point was essentially treasonous, and would result in terrible consequences.

They told me how Trump was a vicious homophobe who was openly stating he wanted to round up gays for forced conversion therapy, and that he was super racist.

This contradicted my own experience with Trump on LGBT, so I asked for a link, or a clip, or just anything at all to support these allegations.

Literally, my only response was: "Can you shoot me a link or quote or something?"

I was de-friended by half my family.

I was labelled a homophobe and a racist.

A very close relative wrote me a long letter explaining how I must be a crypto-misogynist who cannot accept a woman leader... After I had worked with her on feminist activism for three fucking decades.

Oh, and the gays-off-roof-thing?

It was rationalized as "If it's against the law to be gay there, they should find a different way to express themselves" 

...which is baffling to say the least, and completely shits on all concept of "born this way"

All I did was ask for a link and I was disowned by half my family, and most of my friends.

I can't wait for some new party to form that embraces classic liberal values.

Until then, miss me with the political hate and anger. My #walkaway
needlessdefiance “I am a Democrat.” - Will Rogers.


But seriously, #Bernie2020. Or #ElizabethWarren2020. Or someone else, I’m open to suggestions. I am not a member of any organized political party,
ConcernedPoster112 Make sure you head on over to r/askthe_donald, r/conservative, r/gunpolitics too! Downvote every Russian post there! This is just the tip of the iceberg!  Don't just brigade here!
tenderlogna They lost me when they started defending Islam's homophobia whilst calling Trump supporters homophobic. Irony anyone?

AND why the fuck is transgendered in there? That's about gender, not sexuality. Don't lump that shit in with the rest. 

Also, bisexual indicates two genders. Not 56.

Thanks. Walkaway from the LGBT gang too
ICareDontU Jews here. I was voting member in Democrat party for many a years. I vote for Obama, I vote for Clinton, I vote for Carter, I vote for Johnson, I vote for Kennedy. Now left voters not civil. Why??? I will now vote Republicans for rest of life. Make Americas Great Agains! As real Americans, I say is time to walk aways
Cherbum Я сосать большие члены Здравствуйте
StephenMillerButtSex With their BLM murdering police and stopping good normal Americans who are just trying to get home on the highway. Donald Trump has done more for the black community than the entire civil rights movement. They're complete ingrates. Maybe it's the low IQs. They wouldn't even listen when Kanye told them that slavery was a choice. They worship Hillary Clinton. It's time we all #walkedaway from freeloaders and socialists. #Walkaway from black people.
IFearedForMyLife /r/GamersRiseUp I was a Democrat, until ethics in gaming journalism made me leave.
Banniess Titles says it all. First I got banned for "inciting violence" while all I did was quote other users' violent rhetoric and commenting on how abhorrent that was (comments like "Bash the fash - Good, Trump supporters should be punched" etc etc). Contacted the mods but they just said I was trolling and that's that. 

I made a point to never throw random insults around although I did once called someone an asshole but he deserved it really. I still regret it because now I can't say that I never insulted ever because that would be a lie. Still, I never broke the rules but apparently I should be banned from /r/politics while the users I quoted get to stick around and hurl more insults and violent rhetoric around there.

/r/politics is controlled by a very nasty part of the left and I want no part of it. It definitely isn't bipartisan nor do the people there vote in a mature and rational matter. It's actually kind of a relief to be banned from the screeching there.

Oh and to the people from /r/politics that are now brigading here: this is on you, take some responsibility. Actions have consequences.  Got banned from /r/politics without breaking the rules
xxmyredpillxx I see there are several mods for this sub and yet you're allowing blatant trolls to dominate the conversation. The accusations that #walkaway is a Russian plot belong in /r/conspiracy, not here. I really urge you to take a harder line and delete those kinds of comments, because this sub is not serving its purpose. I am not interested in the rantings of people afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome. Hey mods? A suggestion.
pestomaton Seeing neo-nazis march through the streets was my single biggest reason for walking away from the republican party. I can't, in good conscience, try to make excuses for these hateful monsters. Charlottesville
BingbongXbingbongX First off, the obvious. 95% of #walkaway posts are just LARPing Trumplicans. It's soooo easy to see through these fake posts. 

Secondly, humans are rational actors. They don't just abandon their ideologies because a Twitter post told them to.

Thirdly, Trumpism is a reactionary rhetoric. It doesn't even exist without liberals. The only way he can defend his capricious and rude behavior is through the perspective of him being in a constant state of defense. He has a license to be a total asshole and 'madman' because he has to 'fight back' against the Democrats. The Republican's in power ironically need the Democrats, because without them they would have to take responsibility for the state of the country. They'd actually be held accountable for their actions.

Finally, xenophobia can only be used to control certain people. If you don't already hate immigrants the Trumpian mindset doesn't make sense. Basically all Trump did was copy what conservative talk radio guys have been saying for the past 5 years and get a bunch of suckers to vote for him. People who don't already have that hate in their hearts aren't going to be fooled by this rhetoric. Trump is trying to put a moratorium on altruism. He tells us that caring about other human beings makes us weak and venerable. Nobody is walking away from the Democratic party because they like the ideals of tolerance. Preaching hate and fear will not pull anyone away from the Democratic party, rather it only validates the need for the Democratic party in this country. Why the #walkaway movement has failed
NateC2k You Trump supporters are pathetic.  Like liberals and left members use the work cuck.

Go fuck off the whole world hates you guys. Pathetic
NateC2k You Trump supporters are fucking pathetic...making a fake sub and pretending to act like people are walking away from the left.  
Little advice... don't ban people and leave a comment that just says cuck.  We don't use that term you morons.

BTW the whole world hates your asses. Pathetic
IN_U_Endo HAHA HAHA, you all got ousted as Russian trolls
Shnazzyone Just curious What's it like trying to manipulate the political opinions of people in a foreign country on behalf of a terrible leader like Putin?
Csauter36 You do understand that you all coming here for nothing more than spamming, insulting, and down voting because we are willing to think freely, is exactly why this exists right? Like, you literally just prove our points over and over again. You know, for us apparently being nothing more than a fake 1000 person sub with Russian bots, there sure is a lot of effort feon the left to brigade us.
LIBTEARSSHILLMAGA I walked away from the Democratc party and I haven't looked back. Their talking points make no sense and they are the biggest hypocrites I've seen.  They pretend to be tolerant but aren't. Mention Trump to them and they spaz out like monkeys. 

Lies and fake news are what their slogan should be and it's a mess.  I cannot stand the Democratic party anymore.
demonicgamer It was August, I was on vacation. A fat whale got things deleted off reddit. Then what happened was incredible: the entire media apparatus backed her up, based on lies. We saw journalists coordinating in real time.

Things like Clinton News Network were cute Republican slogans until then.  


It only got worse. Lies upon lies. Chopping up videos, misquoting, leaving out context to make things the opposite of what they were.  


The FBI investigated the 'movement' since there were claims it was a bunch of Russian bots... found nothing. Every study on the tweets and messages found virtually zero harassment (sub 1-2&amp;#37; numbers), they even got SVU to do an episode.  


Well imagine my shock when as the campaigns were gearing up I had given up trust and checked everything, turns out the same things was going on again.  


Then we were mocked about the 'her emails', just check this list out - which is a bit biased of course - but nowhere close to what we have been treated for the past 4 years - from what I  have witnessed at least - obviously this has been happening as far back as 2006 - when a friend of mine talked to me about the TEA party and I didn't pay attention. But I remember the conversation: they find people that look quirky, they get a weird, funny or preposterous quote and they use that to paint the whole movement. Normal people (normies) don't look into it further - who really wants to go into crazy? - and the movement loses traction as it is ridiculed and lied about by muppets that repeat the same thing over and over.  


Here is a nice collection of 'but her emails': [www.mostdamagingwikileaks.com](https://0www.mostdamagingwikileaks.com)  


which is apparently their most successful meme, because we all know now that the 'left can't meme'  


Meme Veteran (cringe anarchy call out) I walked away in 2014 when I saw the media collusion first hand
SupremeAnaconda That’s a joke because everyone is delusional, and acting like anyone who doesn’t conform to the group-think is a Russian shape-shifter.

I’ll keep it as bullet points, because leftists can’t comprehend why anyone would think diff:

- PC brainwashing is garbage

- Clinton caused wars in Libya, Syria, and Ukraine, and knew their actions were feeding ISIS

- The unquestioning attitude of people with media. Just total repeat of 2003. 

- Trump has had a single message and intent, and has been acting on it singularly his whole campaign, and getting done what he promised.

 Zdrasse Comrades! My #Walkaway
The_Court_Jester C'mon now This subreddit is pathetic
Ss4gogeta0 Seriously, how are you dumbfucks even calling yourself american? 

Instead of bitching about things, do something about it. This Walkaway bullshit is stupid as fuck and serves as a way to divide the country even more while also causing strife and chaos. 

Pinche Americanos!  You guys are dipshits for believing something so obviously done to divide the american people
CamesJomey It's just hundreds of bots jerking each other off. This sub should be marked NSFW
officedrone920 Around 2014 i realized that the Dem party was pretty much the Republican party from when i was a kid. I was raised Dem (Liberal) and have been very politically intelligent my entire life. 

The identity politics and corporate cronyism really turned me off to everything. When the 2016 election came around i was all in for Bernie. Once the info about the DNC came out I was not too shocked over it but it did leave a bad taste in my mouth. 

What i am saying is that yes, the Dems do kinda suck but you do not need to align yourself with either the Dems or the Republicans. I see myself as moderate but with a heavy left leaning side but i do not blindly support every single little thing from the left. Although i do not call myself a Democrat I do and will continue to vote for them because there really is no other choice at this point. 

Now, we all know that the Russians are pushing this movement and I understand that it's to have people leave a party and mess with the elections coming up but i'm here to let people know that even though there is no other "team" to align yourself with you can still stay registered under the Dem party and vote for whatever your conscious feels best. I may not love the Dem party but I do believe in their willingness to change with new blood and democratic socialist ideals. Conservatives have literally lost their minds and I would rather spend the next four or so years with a nice status quo all while changing the party from within than give the keys over to religious fundamentalists who would make Jesus feel ashamed.

This is not meant for the bots, trolls, and T_D fakers but those actual people who think this is a good idea. If you hate Trump or the republicans but you can't stand being a Dem then don't be a dem, but you can still use your vote and time to advocate for a change. The left is willing to evolve and change, which is contrary to the idea of conservatism. 

There is always hope.  Not a fan of the Democratic party but hear me out.
DsntMttrHadSex I think we should find the people behind the pictures and tell them how they were used. Where are you, /u/spez? How could this all happen in here? Is every picture stolen here or just every second?
Mcbotbyl Democrats have not done the average person any favors, unless it profited them to do so. Even in states they hold long standing majorities in there is still massive problems with homelessness, lack of proper education, and a lack of any progress.

Join us over at r/socialism for a better future for all people! Do walk away, no matter what any of the brigaders here tell you.
LSUsparky I've been seeing this sub pop up in jest in a few popular subs and while most people are joking about you guys being mostly Russian bots (let's be honest, given the movement's timing and the mod history list I've seen floating around, this reaction is not entirely without justification), but I'm not a person comfortable with sitting in a bubble and I want to see if I can't speak to some of you directly. Another liberal posted asking to what those of you in this movement are walking away. I thought this was a great question but I am a little concerned with some of the the top answers in that thread as they seemed to proport not walking away to anything at all, and instead just leaving the party to make a statement. But this is an unrealistic (or at least maybe an overly idealistic) picture of the state of politics in America. The sad truth is that if rather than voting for the party which aligns most closely with your interests, you don't vote at all, statistically this is exactly equivalent to one more vote for the candidate with whom you agree the least. This is because your missing vote is one less vote the other party has to cancel out with one of their own. You're walking to the other side of the isle whether that is where you meant to go or not. I'm not going to just call you bots but I also fail to see how this movement is going to serve the interests of anyone involved, especially since the Republican party is currently in power and positioned further right than ever. But if you believe that this will make things better, feel free to share your input. Honest question from a liberal: Do you understand what #walkingaway really means? If so, is this really the best solution?
slappy_patties Good questions.

From what?  Collectivism in favor of free thought.  The left has built their foundation with identity politics, and a heirarchy of oppression.  Maybe, just maybe, there are easier explanations for men making more money than assumping systematic oppression.  Maybe, just maybe the same goes for the incarceration of blacks.  Maybe, just maybe, the benefits of diversity are purely theoretical.

All of this is to say, if you think the rule of law is the single most important thing to a constitutional republic, the left despises you.  I walked away from that in 2013 after voting for Obama twice.

Thanks bye. Walking away from what, and to what?
likdisifucryeverytym I used to be a liberal because my parents were and I just followed them. But now mom isn’t giving me the good tendies anymore and she’s telling me to get a job and leave the house for once.

WhatYonder1 Voted for Obama twice. Bernie phone banker and Stein voter (protest vote). 

Once you see the ShareBlue trolls and understand how they manipulate large influential forums as a 9-5 job, then it doesn't take some huge leap to understand some things that nagged at the back of your mind for years.

There are Tammany Hall style criminals on both sides, but the left marches in lock-step. They're the kind of people whose opponents commit suicide, per the police reports, with two bullets to the back of the head (look it up). They act like The Mob.

Here's a fun thought. How far would the Mafia go for $1 million? Would they lie? Corrupt politicians? Cover up crimes? Pay off cops? Would they commit murder for $1 million? How many people, do you think? How about for $1 billion? I walked away before the election. Then I found The_Donald. Paid trolls sealed the deal. These people are sick.
Chesney1995 Guess the only option left is to walk away and become racist, sexist, and homophobic and start backing Russian subs like this one. I'm liberal but I don't agree with the Democratic party...
itsmemilo13 Dumped for saying that I wasn't going to vote for HRC. My girlfriend got all of her relations and friends to harass me in public, her friends would find me and yell at me in public. She said that they would only stop if I became a fees paying member of the Democrats. So now I've #walkedaway for real now. I'm glad that this issue has a platform. Dumped and harassed for not voting HRC
easye2889 Picked it up after wanting to "read the enemy"  ended up finding many allies. I walked away after reading Righteous Indignation
LegioCI I am just like other Americans and do not want to have lots of immigrants from South countries like Mexico, Brazil, and Georgia who bring drugs and terrorism to country and want strong relationship with other great country of Federation of Russia! I am helping to making america greatest again! USA #1! Hello Fellow American Liberals, I too am of making America Great Again by support Trump!
kirkl3s Comrades I am write to salute and tell that I am walk away from the liberals partys in Amerika. I was formerly support for Hillary Jefferson Clinton but am now on the President Donald Trump locamotive that is unable to be stop.

Pls let our fellow countrymans know that the path to great is on the right and not on the left.

thanks you Hello I am walk away
dick_inspector This is pathetic, a bunch of alt-right children and Russian bots pretending to be liberals who changed their mind about politics. What is the point of this? You realize you are just talking to each other... I am truly speechless. LMFAO. What are you people even doing?
Triggered_irl Hello ~~comrades~~ patriots. I had to walk away from disgusting Democratic party because of evil Hillary. Now I go to sleep every night holding doll of Alex Jones and say my prayer to ~~Putin~~ Trump before going to bed. I Walked Away
Red_Don The other ones post in r/ the_donald and r/ conservative Y.S.K. Three of the R/Walkaway Mods are also Mods at R/HillaryforPrison and R/TheNewRight
jake_fordyce Seems to be quite a few people that walked away at around the same time. My story is pretty similar to theirs.

I've considered myself a Democrat for as long as I've thought about politics. Been registered D since I was 18 and voted for Obama twice. I never really paid any attention to politics other than tuning in to see who won the presidential election. I would parrot stupid things like "the only reason anyone is voting against Obama is racism".

Leading up to the 2016 election I was a big Bernie bro. I had never read anything about socialism, whether "democratic" or otherwise. I listened to a few of his speeches and debates and I liked what I heard but never really dug more into it. From the 2 minutes clips socialism sounded terrific. I was all ready to sign up for overthrowing the 1% and the damn corrupt oligarchy that ruled our country. 

When discussing this with people I had one friend in particular who was never afraid to disagree with me. He is a very smart guy whom I respect and enjoy arguing with because we both keep it civil and to the point (it never devolves into name calling or either of us getting angry with each other, we always are attacking the ideas and not the person). I admit I never had really good defenses for the positions I held as he tried patiently to show me that I was wrong. I thought at the time that my lack of convincing him was due to something he was missing in my argument instead of the other way around.

I also had another friend with whom I loved to share anti-sjw videos. I've always considered them a small fringe of the left wing so it never bothered me to still consider myself a Democrat. The videos were mostly stuff like Milo, Crowder, or Shapiro "owning" sjws or feminists. I noticed they also were very critical of Bernie but I never paid attention to that. Figured noone is right about everything so naturally they'd have flaws there too.

Then the big turning point happened. We were struggling through the DNC nomination process and even though they were playing dirty I was ready to vote for Bernie once he finally caught his break and tossed out Hillary. But that didn't happen. What happened is he dropped out and gave his support to Hillary. To me she is the face of big, corrupt, status-quo government and everything I didn't want. That was the moment when I started to consider that maybe some of the criticism I had heard of Bernie, Democrats, and Progressivism in general had some merit.

From then on I began to dig deeper. I started reading more and watching/listening to every person I could find that talked about politics. I examined my stance on all of the major political positions and even wrote out a journal of my thoughts as I worked through how I really felt about it all. This soul searching is still continuing but so far I have found that I don't really agree with the Democrats on almost any stance.

At the 2016 election I voted Trump. It wasn't because I was 100% behind him, I just knew he was a wildcard and he definitely wasn't status quo. With Hillary I knew what I would be getting was something I didn't want. With Trump there was at least a chance that he would be better than his speeches lead you to believe.

I'm hoping now that the Libertarian movement takes off so we have an option that more aligns with my stances. I also walked away in 2016
funktopus After years of being a die-hard member of the GOP she walked away. Now she is backing the Democratic party. My godmother walked away
ShadyMcFly You want me to walk away from the only party who:

-takes global warming seriously
-concerned about wealth inequality
-sees healthcare as a right
-doesn’t want to ban abortions
-doesn’t want family separations at the border
-wants dark money out of politics
-doesn’t have self-described Nazis and white supremacists running for office in their ranks
-didn’t explode the debt by transferring an enormous amount of wealth to the richest of the country
-wants renewable energy over fossil fuels


Because of what....identity politics? Genuine Question From A Liberal
sikagoon7 Title Can I get an honorary ban from this bullshit Russian propoganda subreddit?
givemeastoutplz Hello [SUBREDDITNAME]. I used to be brother of Bernie before people’s democratic President Trump spoke many truths to us. Just like you I was lifelong Democrat Party operative before enemy of people Hillary did very bad thing. Now I #walkaway from long and glorious career of liberal values because of many lie against friend of America Russia and evil by Deep State Mueller who is ?%%enemy. Please join with me in completely real not fake movement. Maga and thanks to all you for sharing of real story. Hello I Am WalkAway Too
p251 Its full of snowflakes  I cannot stand the Republican party anymore.
FrankTank3 I wanna learn more. Can anyone help me? Where should I start?
ORDub I walked far away from the GOP during the elections when I saw what a shit-show it had become.  When Trump won (not with my vote), I knew I made the right call.  Now that all the Russian shit us coming out, I can’t believe I was part of that party for so long.

Adios GOP forever. I walked away
FRZU It seems this sub has already gotten taken over by die-hard Democrats trying to defend what the party has become and deflect to Trump.

I just found the sub today.  Is this just a temporary brigading or is this sub already toast? Is there anything mods can do to save this sub?
YeahIfYouCouldJust how them boots taste? I'm a Liberal, but I'm not here to brigade. I simply have one question
FlippingandDipping I walked away in 2016 before #walkaway was a thing. I am happy to see my brothers and sisters here sharing their stories. It feels good to be an immortal Russain Bot. 

Good day! Hello Fellow Russains Robots, I have decided to #WalkAway too, forever!
calls_you_nouns I remember back when I *totally* wasn't a trump supporter and this thing happened and now I *am* a trump supporter

Share your own 110% totally accurate actually happened stories about why you left the democrats How do you do, Fellow Democrats?

Thanks to SJWs for helping me find this page for if it were not for their perpetual outrage I would have never known about it. I walked away
NotANaziFriendo I grew weary of the trash and propaganda on r /politics. I made this alt to confront the trolls and was banned for straying from the hive mind. They suck. I walked away, and r/politics banned me for it
The_Bird_King Liberals hate men, white people, Christians, and children so why should they support them? I'm not white but I don't hate white people and sadly, that's a controversial statement now. Liberals only care about immigrants because none of us want to vote for them so instead of changing their stances to match ours, they just import new voters to replace us.  I walked away many years ago and I want to show my support.
pylorih Hi guys,

I too enjoy being a cuck that walks away from democratic principles when the Red wagon is hot hot hot.

I know you all walked away during Bush, this isn't anything new to you.... Walking away
captain-bitcoin $2 for extra guacamole? Fuck that shit.  #walkaway #TRUMP2020 I walked away!

Patriot1776MAGA Make America great again I decided to walk away when Obama gave billions of dollars to Iran. America does not negotiate with terrorists. Democrats are weak on crime and week on the border.
rsashe1980 We are looking for mods that have experience modding or are willing to learn. We use toolbox for reddit and also must be able to use discord for communication. DM me on reddit or DM my Discord username rsashe1980#2683. #WalkAway We are looking for mods! We are looking for motivated mods to help grow/mod the sub and help spread the #WalkAway movement.
BasedBoyScout Hey guys. Just wanted to throw some support behind this sub.

I'm a Conservative Libertarian that was horrified by the Bush Administration that voted for Obama in both his elections.

In 2015 I thought Trump's bid for the Presidency was literally a joke but as I watched the election evolve and watched the spoon fed propaganda go well and beyond the normal "acceptable" level of dirty politics.....I didn't just walk away I ran the fuck away as fast as possible, joined r/The_Donald and never looked back.

I can appreciate that not everyone likes our current President, I respect people's right to do so....but I congratulate all of you for seeing what your party is becoming, and rejecting its agenda of fear, lies, misrepresentations, and despite.

Whoever you choose to embrace politically, I hope they give you some semblance of justification for your faith in our country in the future. I'm super jazzed to see yet more people that may not share my political views, that could potentially have a logical conversation about it rather than resorting to "MUH RUSSIA" or "U POAST IN DER\_DANGNALD".

Good luck I truly hope this movement is the spark that allows the people to retake control of the Democratic Party, because I think it was highly obvious who controlled it in 2016.  I'll Walk with you....
FunGuyWhoDoesntTroll The liberals’ knee jerk reactions to this sub are yet another example of why so many people are walking away.

I didn’t vote for Trump, but I definitely will in 2020. The racist, sexist, hateful actions of the left have shown me the light. Liberal Response...
DifferentThrows It’s how you know we’re winning.  This place is fucking under FIRE right now.
SnipedYou I just want to start off with that I am a registered Democrat, voted Bernie in the 2016 primaries and HRC in the general. I want to use this opportunity to get my thoughts off on the perceived polarization in the US.

Immigration may be the most polarizing issue we have faced in a generation. And along with immigration we get it's proxy - racism. From the 14th amendment anyone born on US soil and subject to our jurisdiction is granted citizenship. Because of the 14th amendment we have families in the US where a parent or 2 is here illegally while the children are American citizens. That brings us to the current issues: What should we do about illegal immigrants currently in America and how do we prevent people from entering the country illegally? 

Americans overwhelmingly think that DREAMers should be given a path to citizenship, but do we extend the same thing to the parents? If we extend it to the parents are we then rewarding them for entering the country illegally, is that fair especially to people that spend upwards of 10 years and 10s of thousands of dollars to get here legally?

Ok so maybe we can't put the parents on a path to citizenship, but we can institute a guest worker program. Guest worker programs can help resource starved industries, for example agriculture, to get labor outside the domestic market to meet demand. This was debated in the Republican immigration session. How can we prevent illegal immigrants from acquiring work? Currently it is optional for an employer to do an e-verify check and the latest immigration bill that was proposed, once again by the republicans, would make it mandatory. Ok these sound reasonable right?

This ones the kicker, the wall. Seen by most Americans as a waste of money and racist. Truthfully I don't really know how I feel about the matter now if the guest worker program is instituted and e-verify becomes mandatory. Since we want to stem the flow of illicit drugs, guns and other contraband across the border the wall could help with that by funneling people to ports of entry. I could perhaps get behind a wall if the republicans propose a plan to fund it and extensive wildlife tests are performed. Otherwise it seems wildly unnecessary. 

DJT now wants to give illegal border crossers no right to due process. To some extent I think it is completely un-American to do so, but at the same time our current way of handling the matter is unsustainable. Catch-and-release didn't work as most people would be absent for their asylum trial, in-absentia, and the backlog would take years. Assigning more judges is not addressing the root of the problem. All of these things Republicans have proposed and the Democrats have just resisted and the electorate has noticed. I am beyond pissed at my party for not chipping in to find a solution that everyone can agree to.

If we are to solve the immigration problem there will be some troubles ahead and families may need to be split, but I truly believe we can find common ground and a solution that works for all. Remember that the solution will cause pain in the short-term, but will be beneficial to everyone in the long-term. Until the democrats come up with a solution that isn't, "rearrange ICE", they have lost my vote. Just like in a relationship with a gf, remember it's not you vs. her. It's the Democrats and the Republicans vs. the problem. My thoughts on the matter
EffLiberals Progressive Lieberals can go fuck themselves because anyone you disagree with is a Nazi.

TheJuniorisI #BlueWave2018 TRUMP SUCKS ASS
WallyTheWelder This movement has gotten alot of traction in the last few days, primarily because of being acused of Russian origins. It would be a lot more credible if people took pics of themselves with their usernames and the date to prove you're a real human. Kind of like the nsfw subs that require authentication, but to prove you're a human. You can cover your face if you like but if you're actually proud of what you're doing, you can put doubters to rest with simple proof. That shouldn't be too hard. I don't think you people are as irrational as die hard T_d'ers so I think you can understand where I come from. There's been a surge in Russian bot activity in the last few days. P
Is it too much to ask you prove this sub isn't a propoganda arm of Russia? Proof
kanyelibritarian This doesn’t need to be another political meme page. If its not someone sharing their story, maybe it doesn’t belong here. The mods should consider deleting any post that isn’t a testimonial about walking away.
DONT_reply_with_THIS We shouldn't punish the law abiding citizens because someone wants to be a criminal. 

In the Marines we would frequently get punished as a platoon to company to battalion if someone got a DUI because the commanders were trying to instill the "team" mentality. It didn't work, a ton of us were punished for the idiocy of the minority. 

I will never give up my right to bear arms. The Democrat party pushed too far and lost me forever. I also realized I get a long a lot better with right leaning people. Personal responsibility leads to a life that's full of success. 

Illegals will have to go back. I've seen illegals be treated as subhuman animals because they're here illegally and some people prey upon them. They have to go back where they came from, not only for our sake, but for their own sake as well.

I was a liberal through high school and well into my university years post USMC. I will never return to that mentality because I am no longer a slave to the Democrat party. I am a Marine Corps infantry veteran and I walked away because my right to bear arms will not be infringed upon because some crazy person shot innocent people
Xen0bus We love to feed the Russian bots. Welcome Comrads
turderer Years back I was a self-described socialist. My first election I was old enough to participate in was the 2000 election and I supported Nader, because at the time the Dems were too right wing for me. I supported government childcare, the raising of the minimum wage, the implementation of the maximum wage, universal healthcare, banning fossil fuels, and abortion on demand.

I think it was the next year I started to have my doubts. The Greens put on a huge rally in Portland called Nader Rocks where they invited the most prominent Greens to speak. Nader, Jello Biafra, the singer of Pearl Jam, and a few others. They also had huge conferences in the Memorial Colosseum on gender politics, environmentalism, LGBT rights, stuff that even at the time the Democrats didn't really care about. I remember how much it struck me how angry and judgmental all those people were. I didn't really want to be a part of that and the hard left were so damn negative I couldn't take it. These people now run the party, sadly. 

By 2004 I was a big supporter of Kerry for president. I wanted to end the war and stop Bush. After Kerry lost, the rhetoric started to really sour from the Dems. By 2008 things started to get pretty nasty. People on the left were constantly bashing people, especially the "Fundies" which is a term you hear less and less these days, and about how awful and evil they were. Thing is, my family are all that way, and it started to really grateful hearing people I loved get bashed and called names for their politics, even though I disagreed with them I still loved those people and didn't want to hear them be slandered incessantly, so I really started to want to leave by then.

The final straw was when my wife became pregnant with my first child and I saw the ultrasound for the first time. I knew then and there that it was a person I was looking at, a real human being I would have laid down and died for, which pretty quickly led to the political conclusion that I had to be pro-life. I just couldn't stand for abortion anymore. I held my nose and voted Republican because even though I disagreed with them on so much, even though GOP politicians are crooked, I couldn't handle dealing with my own conscience if I supported more abortions.

Today, the left has gone completely insane. Conservatives, not talking about the politicians, the people themselves, are kinder, more open minded, more willing to talk civilly about contentious topics than leftists. I won't say liberals because they aren't liberal any more, they're just left. It really is better over here. 

TLDR left became dicks, I got tired of being associated with them, am right now.

If you think I'm a Russian troll I can post pics of my Chomsky books if you want. I think I have a book on anarcho-syndicalism and the communist manifesto to boot. Walked away 10 years ago
DixieLand82 Abandon ship. Someone needs to start something equivalent to the Underground Railroad.
fellow_conservative I’ve worked in manufacturing for most of my adult life. I used to buy into all the bullshit the Dems pushed. Tolerance, immigration, taxing the rich to provide benefits to citizens, you name it. I believed in the union for providing work conditions and wages that helped my family.

All my work buddies are soon to retire. Throughout the last few decades immigrants have been replacing my coworkers. They don’t speak English or acknowledge me in public. I shouldn’t have to tolerate these immigrants who are getting welfare that I paid for. These people are either lazy moochers or jerks. Work is unbearable. I had to leave the Democratic Party.  #walkaway union guy
aldehyde stupid motherfuckers walk yourselves into a knife
Oh_No_Leon_Lett My views never changed but team blue moved so far left, I ended up on the right. This is not progressive, its regressive. Not sure I walked away rather than pushed away.
Turboboxer Please keep on believing! I love you all each and everyone! Any and everyone are loved and welcome in the USA!!!!  Holy Shit!!! This sub is bigraded more than T_D
UnperformedKubrick I am also top scientist of USA and have had sex with over 6 women.  I was very liberal and believed in lots of liberal stuff but the blue hair people were mean to Donald so now I hate Mexicans
sciencelord The #WalkAway Campaign is a grassroots campaign created by Brandon Straka. It is a video campaign movement, dedicated to sharing the stories of people who can no longer accept the current ideology of liberalism and what the Democratic Party has become. Some left long ago. Many of us have recently been “red-pilled”. Some here have wanted to leave for some time, but have feared the consequences they might suffer from friends or family if they walk away. The phony "russian bot" story mixed with the massive amount of briggaders here is why people are walking away, keep doubling down!
loopdojo I went from:

Voting for Obama twice

Bernie sign in my yard, canvassing in my county

Watching fellow Dems make excuses for protestors blocking highway on-ramps. 

Watching fellow Dems make excuses for Hillary

Arguing with people on the_donald and getting banned

Listening to Thomas Sowell, Joe Rogen, Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson. 

Watching Dems condone the violence of Antifa and not giving a shit about free speech. 

Now I am going to be more than happy to vote for Trump in 2020.  

I have walked away to  become something like a Conservative Libertarian 

I’m not a Republican, but I am certainly not a Dem anymore.  I walked away from the resentful cynical jokes. No arguments, just ad hominem attacks and virtue signaling on the left.
Mammal186 Discuss. Why is Polish Vodka so much better than Russian Vodka?
Cars2Acolyte I come from Jordan. I like the Democrats because they were against the Muslim ban. I looked into their policies and found they are pro gay marriage and porn.

I like the Republicans now because they advocate a state closest to Sharia Law that can be realistically implemented in the US.  Muslim joining the GOP
FableForge I'm not inferior due to my ethnicity. I earned everything I own through my own hard work just like anyone else. But the Democrats can't see past my ethnicity. When they see me, they see somehow who is below them and therefore needs their help. This is patronizing and insulting. The right sees me differently. When they see me, they expect me to work for my own rewards without any handicaps nor special concessions because they know I'm equal to everyone else. 

And I proved them right. If you don't believe me, see the massive welcome T_D gave me the day I finally got my citizenship. No one can read that thread and still accuse us of being racist.

As for being a Russian bot, I have ten years of Reddit history. It's really sad how the left can't even conceive of disagreement to the point where the only plausible explanation they'll accept is 'the Russians did it'. 

That's it. My #walkaway story. Ask me anything. I'm ready to be downvoted too, which only proves my point about leftist intolerance. 

If you really think the left supports minorities, just watch how they treat us the moment we disagree with their ideology. Legal Mexican immigrant here, just became a citizen this year. I supported Obama in 2008, but I finally got tired of the identity politics of the Democrat party, and most of all it's intellectual self-righteous intolerance which you can sample right now by the all the downvotes here.
MaggieButthead I see how everything posted in here gets instantly downvoted.  I love America, your people, food and land are amazing. Its odd watching this party (Democrats) absolutely nuts from president Trump. I hope they realize that people in the middle dont like where they are heading.  Its impossible to talk to people on here. They think Maxine waters telling people to harrass Republicans is ok and just them using their free speach, or protecting.  Send a message. Make Democrats great again. Stay strong Ex Democrats from a Canadian.
nwdogr https://mobile.twitter.com/SteveSchmidtSES/status/1009325231004004352 Steve Schmidt walks away
SeatedLiberty I'm a Democrat because I believe in liberal values. Liberal values include freedom of speech (which left-wing individuals are [more likely to support](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10392043/Screen_Shot_2018_03_09_at_11.29.46_AM.png)), free private practice of religion (including Islam), secular government (including the absence of Evangelical influence on America), free movement (yes, I support a form of open borders), and others.

I'm a Democrat because democratic (small d) norms are important to the continued function of our government, and the Republican Party appears on a mission to violate nearly every one of them. 

I'm a Democrat because the GOP will fill the courts with social conservatives that pose a threat to the well-being of my loved ones for decades.

I'm a Democrat because, despite all their flaws, the Democrats overwhelmingly represent my ideal platform better than Republicans, and hold themselves to a much higher moral standards. There's no reason to even consider walking away when the only two things I agreed with the GOP on (trade and immigration) have been abandoned in favor of right-wing populism. Why I'm a Democrat
UnclaimedUnderpants Exactly how can you support Trump and still believe you have any conservative values whatsoever? Conservative values.
Capriricious The Russians did this, the Russians did that! Russians helped Trump win! They aren’t leaving our party, its just Russian trolls! Can no one just accept that maybe, just maybe, the Russians aren’t behind every one of their parties downfalls? Whats the deal with Russians?
ztoundas I've up and changed everything I believe because some people were *mean* to me on the internet. Darn cuck snowflakes! Calling my dissent just a 'bot' made me #WalkAway
Unique__Username123 Always voted democrat until last election, just couldn't vote for Hillary. Feels good actually.  I walked away
yu658lkgf This place is amazing, it's going to be huge. Please don't overreact to the trolls, let them spread all the hate they want-it's just who they are as people.  To the ones walking away, nothing but the best regardless of where you end up...hugs all around. Hi All.
AnonymousUser225 I walked away after hearing about the DNC’s shenanigans and then being criticized for speaking my mind about it.

It all started when I heard that Donna Brazile gave the debate questions to Clinton. However, the only reason I and other people knew this was through wikileaks. And when I brought this up to my liberal friends they told me Wikileaks was propaganda. But then Donna Brazile confessed to giving the debate questions to Clinton. This was definitive proof that the DNC was picking favorites, and my liberal friends went from calling wikileaks propaganda to then calling Bernie Sanders someone who wasn’t even a Democrat. Combine this with the DNC’s disgusting use of superdelegates to help Clinton  get the nomination undemocratically, and I was gone. 

#WalkAway

As a side note, for those who want to comment saying, “You’re not even a liberal you post in T_D.” I started using reddit sometime in 2017. This story is from the election year of 2016. My Walkaway Story From 2016
rsashe1980 Just kidding!

Just so you all know, we are currently being brigaded by “former” default subreddit /r/AdviceAnimals for “Being a pathetically transparent scam by “Russian Trolls.” If you look further in the comments of that normie meme sub, their supposed evidence for their very strong claim they are propagating seems to be this post here from someone in /r/politics (the true bastion of political neutrality! /s) In that post, they quote and refer to this one thread here which was made by a pretty obvious troll that was called out in the comments, their post was completely buried in downvotes, and their account was soon suspiciously deleted as well. Based on that one troll post and another questionable comment that was downvoted in the same thread, they think it’s now okay to conflate everyone who follows and posts to this community as “Russian Trolls”, even if it couldn’t be further away from reality. They are also trying to conflate a laughably tiny number of suspicious Russian accounts on twitter who hijacked #WalkAway to be representative of the entire movement as well, because Radical Leftists can’t possibly accept that they are rapidly pushing away moderate leftists and centrists thanks to very silly instances like this (And because most of them are BATSHIT INSANE!)

The truth is the #WalkAway movement was started by Brandon Straka, and since it’s conception has gained lots of traction thanks to other prominent leaders such as Candace Owens and Scott Adams. And at this point in time, the movement has completely blown up in popularity! So yeah, please keep dismissing everyone who disagrees with you as “Russian Bots” and see how far that gets you. "You got us we are Russian bots. Details inside..."
IsAfraidOfGirls I tried to vote for Bernie int he Primaries but couldn't because of an address change. Ended up voting Trump in the general and don't regret it one bit. A Steven Crowder video made me realize how retarded Bernie's socialist platform was and slowly tons of red pills started hitting me like crazy. I am now a right-wing Trump loving conservative and I now own 7 guns and will do whatever it takes to protect our rights. 


 I left the democrat plantation right after primaries.
Pomilui My whole family used to be dems, but the union days are over.  Speak for yourself, and don't pay anyone else to speak for you! BLEEEEEEEEEP!!!! BLOOOOOOOP!!!
Stupendous_Intellect I always considered myself to be a moderate as a young adult in Southern California. After college, I’d watch Wolf Blitzer on CNN every morning while I ate my cereal before heading to work. I did a little reading on each candidate before voting, but never down a party ticket. I began seeing how much I was paying in state and federal taxes and social security, then watched the government mismanage it and explain that they need to increase taxes, and I began to open my eyes.

I watched as Obama won the primary and the Democrats ran on a platform of electing the first black president. I watched him receive the Nobel Peace Prize for doing absolutely nothing at all, then he destabilized Syria and Libya and suddenly ISIS became America’s biggest threat. Then, as I saw my employer health plan deteriorate into one with a $2500 deductible as soon as Obamacare was enacted. I didn’t particularly like either candidate running in 2008 and 2012, but I now see that Obama did more damage to America and race relations within it than any president in my lifetime. 

I’ve been on Reddit for years, but my ultimate red pill was taken during the Pulse Night Club shooting when the default news subs and r/politics began censoring all comments and posts as soon as the gunman was identified as Muslim. Even posts explaining where to go to donate blood we’re getting deleted. The only place for uncensored news that day was The_Donald and I found the community to be very welcoming and hilariously funny. I can’t unsee the corruption within the Democrat party and the racism it promotes while calling for equality. Absolutely disgusting and I will never vote for a Democrat candidate again in my lifetime. My walkaway story wasn’t a moment, it was a slow stroll until mid-2016.
Politiskep It's true, I need to get a life. But I did it for you.  I have been following politics and current events very closely since the beginning of the 2016 campaign season, and went from a Sanders supporting liberal to a diehard Trumpian conservative. AMA
SAP_WINDOWS_SQL I'm voting for Donald J. Trump in the next election.  I thought that voting was useless, as every president did the same thing, empty promises. My grandmother and grandfather were staunch miner democrats.  They would roll over in their grave with todays pigs.  #walkaway I haven't voted in the last 3 elections...but I'm going to now
Lil_Gay_Udyr I grew up near San Francisco and was a strong supporter for Obama. Unlike most who walked away I still liked Obama. But I can't support the Democrat Party when they butcher grassroot organizations like BLM and make them into a quazi terrorist group. Push and make a fuss out of sexism and race issues when they largely don't exist. I say this as a minority myself. 

The left has become the party of racism and sexism, I doubt many Trump supporters or Republicans have a racist bone in their body, but you hear all these people pushing that they do. I think they are the ones that are racist. I think people like Trevon Martin are thugs, and I think there are a ton of losers who blame their problems on others.  White rednecks will blame it on the government, black people, Mexicans, or another group, but the Republican's don't let this base have a strong voice in their party.  The Democrats took ahold of BLM and let it be an outlet for black trash when it was a respectable movement, regardless of my views on the matter, they have insulted our military and our officer's, and they refuse to realize how non extremists think they are full of shit. People like Maxine Waters and other democrats pander to this crowd to get them elected. I'm with the #WalkAway movement, i'm not a Russian bot, i'm a Democrat who was fed up with how they choose to present themselves.

I was all for Hillary, and I think she would have done decent, not as good as Trump has shown, but the instant she started talking about it being a Woman's issue on why she's being attacked, and not because she's a shitty person and people rallied around her. I knew being centrist wasn't allowed here. We have sanctuary cities in California, needles and thugs ruining a beautiful state. 

I have no issue with immigrants, I don't even mind hardworking illegals. But even the hardworking illegals need to go OUT. They came here and disrespected our law, and what #FAKE NEWS, won't tell you, is that these people don't get deported and Ice doesn't go after people for no reason. The people Ice puts on it's radar and deports are criminals who have broken the law in addition to crossing illegally.

I won't deny that I hate what they are doing to net neutrality, or other policies the Democrats push for. But I will not vote for a racist party who pushes for sexism and racism against not only whites, but even Asians and other minorities. The racists assume that minorities need help to function, the Republicans truly believe in them, believe in them that they have the power to make a dream for themselves. Fuck the racist and sexist Democrats, I #WalkedAway and I plan to stay here where the economy is great, I pay less taxes, i'm not overpaying on my premiums so unhealthy people can get it cheap at my expense,  and where we are proud of our people in uniform and are proud of our fellow countrymen regardless of race or sex. Bring back the Meritocracy, bring back work ethic and stop this #Fake News, where some subreddits are such a hivemind that even as someone who supported Obama, I think they are extremists and any opinion not of the hivemind has left. I walked away because of the left's walk away from meritocracy and into race politics.

WildWook Walked away after the primaries were rigged. I've always aligned myself with democratic ideals, it just took me multiple elections to realize 

a) They don't actually intend to implement these policies
b) Their only talking points are identity politics and attempts to make x group hate x group for x reasons

I want it to be known, I don't think Bernie Sanders is a bad guy, or a bad politician. I think he was misled by a profoundly corrupt DNC who sold itself to the Clinton family long ago. I think the democratic party promises utopian ideals it doesn't deliver. I don't consider myself a republican, I just consider myself no longer a democrat. I don't intend to ever return to the party, it's clear corruption has taken hold of it at the highest level. I will likely be voting independent from here on out. Ex-Bernie voter here.
Pinecone_Pete Maybe I don't understand the position that those brigading have but it seems to be that bots are the predominant pushers of the movement.

Ok, let's assume that is the case. To what end? Specifically, what does Russia gain from a bot campaign that states that people are leaving the Democrat party? Is the thinking that people will leave the party if they see others leaving the party?

If it was astroturf then why worry yourselves about it? What do you gain by bringing attention to it? Don't you stand to lose by bringing attention to it? What would be the point of a movement led by bots?
drworm1537 So what do you guys do in your spare time when your not doing this? Do you really spend a lot of your time squatting or photos in track suits? What do you do for fun? Do you jerk off to American or Russian porn? I myself don’t really care for Russian porn cause it’s usually really rapey and all the guys look like scrawny wads. Do you guys play fortnight or overwatch? I want to get to know the guys behind the keyboards. Thanks ;-) Question
TiredOfLiberalBS Seems like they found out our hiding spot. We've been had vlads. Oh noes what are we doing to do? Should we report to Vladimir so that he can Putin a good word for us to Trump during their meet this month?

I really need to sabotage the Democratic Party with this WalkAway thingy else I can't get my rent money. Any one have any suggestions for next month? Seems like disrupting meals of politicians  is the upcoming trend and I was hoping to use your input to come up with something.

Thanks and Regards,
ID #:RENTFREETILL2024-MAGATRON Hello Russian bots how's it going
_assword My history : voted for Obama, Obama, Bernie and Hillary.  Donated to Bernie and DNC multiple times.  After it was clear Bernie was out I switched to Team Hillary. 

After she lost 4 things happened : 

- I realized the DNC had no plan and was just flailing, I realized they were not going to "pull it together" in any meaningful way.  The DNC will lose to Trump in 2020 because they are completely incompetent.  The top of the party is totally rotten.  There is no hope for the DNC until the Obama / Hillary Mafia is expelled.

- I read a lot of different news papers and realized the liberal papers were WAY more dramatic than the non-liberal papers.  For them the sky was falling.

- I realized a total idiot couldn't accidentally beat 2 political dynasties and 15 candidates

- I realized the Dems were full of shit with their endless list of double standards.  Trump must accept results!  *then* We won't accept the election results! The election cant be hacked! *then* The election was hacked! Republicans shouldnt block Obama supreme court nominee! *then* We will block Trumps supreme court nominee!  The list goes on and on.  Someone could write a book on this, it's really incredible.  

I was told these things, and I researched them all myself and found them all to be false : 

- Trump is a huge racist
- Trump hates women
- Trump is literally Hitler
- Trump is connected to Bannon who is connected to Breitbart and they are racist nazis too
- Trump is a moron

-----

Do you own research thoroughly - believe no one. I walked away because I learned from my own research that Trump &amp; Co were not as bad as advertised. Also, I realized the DNC was totally lost.
SpazzHimself so i asked why they think everything and everyone they dont agree with is somehow a Russian bot. 

Predictable response of hatred and insults and then a ban lol

mrgreencard There were so many reports of voter suppression, last minute changes of voting locations and computer “glitches” during the “democratic” primaries that I knew there was some fuckery afoot. Former bernout here who ultimately voted for based plant lady but after seeing President Trump continue to fulfill campaign promises, he has my full support and I look forward to next 7 years of his presidency.  
  
#MAGA  Walked away during the “democratic” primaries
shambooza The Dems have lost it. There isn't a proper candidate from their side that looks after the people's best interests. It's only Trump this and Trump that. And the recent illegal immigration saga has proved that they only use political situations to their advantage when it benefits them.

I don't know who I'll be voting for in 2020 but it sure ain't the Dems that's for sure. I walked away because
DiscoProphecy This is my original character. Please do not steal. I'm a gay black legal immigrant who defected after SHS got kicked out of Red Hen
ermanito Make sure your story is consistent with your posting history or create a believable alt for your fake story. 

It's really embarrassing seeing people claiming they #walkedway recently with 2+ years of posting history in the_donald or right-wing subs. Suggestion to all those "I walked away when..." posters
DBrowny It started with KONY2012 and I learned what 'slacktivism' was all about, basically being a lazy, useless sack of shit and pretending like you are helping serious problems by sitting on your computer and posting on twitter. After the bataclan attack and facebook flag filters became a thing, I realised this is what the left had become. Complaining about problems that they cause, promoting solutions that will never work. All for the sake of wanting to appear morally superior.

It took a few more years before I realised that literally everyone I've ever known who engaged in that pathetic behaviour was a democrat and it was no coincidence, it is literally late-stage socialism. Ignoring reality, science, economics, biology and everything that makes you feel upset to push a deluded worldview until it all comes crashing down. As long as other people think you are righteous, its all worth it to a modern lefty. Who else started to walk away when facebook flag filters became a thing
STUBBLEMANLINESS Relevant story: I voted for Obama in 2008 (probably because I can telepathically predict neocon braincancer///or I'm good at making shit decisions) but after being forcefed 4 figures of Shared Responsibility dick by the IRS I realized I'd vote for Vermin Supreme over a Democrat (at least he's honest about being a rat)

Anyways that guy from The Apprentice shows up, tells me he's had enough of the bullshit, self funds his campaign by bringing back the trucker hat (I have a very square head, it fits comfortably)

So reluctantly me and my buds go out and vote, hoping we don't get called for jury duty, hoping that someone gives us ass ointment for the communist healthcare dicking we received, and behold: he delivers with big time tax cuts

The downside was that I can't claim HELOC interest as a tax deduction but the upside is that I'm getting fucked so hard by local government that I'll easily make that up anyway

 How the left lost a life long Democrat
Kanyetarian I believe this was about 2 years ago. I always thought democrats were the good guys and went with my feelings. economics was a big wake up call. letting people do what they want &gt; social justice  walked away after high school econ class
NocturnalQuill I am against discrimination in any way, shape, or form, and I believe that any sort of discrimination in the workplace or government should be prosecutable. This includes sex, race, sexual orientation, nationality, etc.

I am in favor of environmental protections. Everyone knows you don't shit where you sleep, and our environment is no different. Climate change is merely one of many ills caused by pollution. We need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and look for alternative energy sources. To this end, I am opposed to fracking and support investing in nuclear power, along with supplementary sources such as wind and solar.

I am pro-labor. Employees should be protected from undue danger and unfair practices by law. No employee should be fired for their beliefs, identity, or for their personal life. More needs to be done to protect the American working class from the threat of outsourcing, and steps need to be taken to ensure that workers displaced by automation can find new jobs.

I support universal healthcare. I believe that the government has an obligation to its citizens to provide them with a minimum standard of medical care, and that a single-payer system is in the best financial interest of taxpayers.

I am a free-speech absolutist. If it isn't a direct call to violence or meant to organize criminal activity, it is unconstitutional for the government to interfere in any way, shape, or form.

I am opposed to the surveillance state. The NSA spying programs unveiled by Snowden are blatantly unconstitutional. Authorities may not legally collect data without a warrant or strong probable cause.

I am vehemently anti-war. Military action should be the absolute last resort in any given situation. Intervention in foreign conflicts is at best a waste of taxpayer money, and at worst mass murder. Bush and Obama are both war criminals in my view.


For all of these reasons, in either their platform or actions, I find the current Democratic party untenable. This is why I chose to walk away. I am a liberal
No-Steppe-on-Pepe When slaves escaped the plantation, hunting parties went out after them to bring them back. We ended physical slavery and it came back as mental, ideological slavery. The same people still claim to own you, and they still go after you if you try to escape. Getting downvotes? That's because you're not allowed to Walk Away from the plantation, boy.
The95Chaps I was a dumbass athiest hillary support and a berniebro, but then i realised that they are on the left, that supports the disgusting gender manipulation movement, so, after a couple of youtube videos, i realised i had to #walkaway I was a walkaway about a year ago
c034lt69 I was all for Obama and the Democratic party when I thought that they cared about people and making the world better. I walked away when I realized it wasn't about healthcare for everyone but forcing people like me (at 22) to pay in an extra $200 a month for insurance I didn't need in the first place. I was all for Obama, then....
frankthegoat Keep thinking for yourselves guys! Love to all with brains. Comrade Frank loves you
eat_biffkin Not sure this counts as I'm in the UK but let's say 3 years ago I couldn't understand the hatred for Obamacare, the passion behind the right to bare arms etc but as I've gotten more into politics and looked at things myself I saw how much the media covered up and pampered for Obama (still don't dislike the guy) while viciously attacking everyone else.

Republicans and the right/centralist are the only people recently that I can support while not agreeing on everything without being attacked.

I can still remain confused by Obamacare, be on the fence about guns while being prochoice without being attacked. I am tired of bullshit and lies and believe politics needs a change, where I laughed and coincidered Trump a joke I now believe him being President is for the best and hope he gets a second term. Pushed away
Dragofireheart Hey dems, when you cheat in your own fucking primary to fuck Bernie over, guess what? You get people that will vote straight Republican for the rest of their lives.

But I'm a evil white supremacist so pay me no mind! /s I already WalkedAway back in 2016.
Absolutrix I'm a half-jamaican half-irish man, but I sexually identify as a FULL AMERICAN. Because I was born here and I like this country. My parents intimidated me into voting for Hillary in 2016. But after seeing how absolutely fucking delusional Trump's victory made them, and how good Trump actually was (I was told he would destroy the economy, not bring balance to it!) I moved out and I'm voting for Trump in 2020.

And now, for everyone... #freeTommyRobinson #FreeDankula #FreeSpeech #MAGA My parents intimidated me into voting for Hillary in 2016. I moved out and I'm voting for Trump in 2020. Here's my story.
Peternimrod I'd rather be offended by some of the more ignorant ppl than shot. I don't want a civil war
Boijoina_Liberalist From a young age I was told the Republicans were the party of fear. I know now that they both are, the big difference is that Democrats want us to be afraid of other Americans (and imaginary Russians) while Republicans are concerned with ISIS and the over representation of violent crimes from illegal aliens. I walked away officially in January 2017 after 14 years of being a registered Dem. The Democrats say they care about the working man but want illegal aliens to provide cheap labor and wreck the wage floor. Fuck em, I'm done.  Cognitive dissonance is a bitch #walkaway
theshovler I have always wanted Trump to be President.  He is a capitalist, makes sense that someone w that kind of experience be put in charge of the country. I am not racist, I believe in equality of opportunity, not outcome.  I am for certain types of sensible regulations, that lead to security, clean air, clean water.  I am for term limits, and voter ID.   I will stand side by side w any American in defending truth, and liberty.  I donate, last year I donated $ over 14k to charities.  I donate time, I regurlarly give time each week to serving others.  If you find yourself walking away, I am the kind of person you're walking towards.   Just a plain clothes Trump Supporter...
norris2017 The title says it all. What is your number 1 reason for walking away from the Democrat part?  What would it take to bring you back? What is your number 1 reason for walking away?
Censorship_of_fools you're mostly cultists from the donald. sure, some of you may have voted D in the past, but this is fake as hell.  obvious LARP is obvious
amaxen I've been watching developments in /r/walkaway.  To sum up they got brigaded and downvoted from /r/AdviceAnimals for being all 'russian bots' without any clear evidence for why that was so.  The brigading appears to have backfired as it pushed /r/walkaway up in popularity and it now has 3.3k subscribers in basically a few days, as well as a number of testimonials.  So, as far as my question goes, #walkaway is a thing, definitely.  Question now is how extensive it is.  I doubt it's 'millions' but I suppose it's possible.  Update re: is walkaway an actual thing or just GOP wishful thinking
PotatoVarnishOrigin cuz there's something wrong with you.

\#walkaway anyone who willingly supports the Democratic Party should visit their medical practitioner to be checked for a concussion
Basilman121 I'm one of many ex-Bernie supporters that #walkedaway just after the primaries. I believed in Bernie's message, including fighting the bureaucrats that were getting rich off of the average American's hard work. I donated to his campaign and tried my best to convince family and friends to vote for him. 


When Hillary was preselected by superdelegates MONTHS in advance of primary elections, I still believed Bernie had a chance. He eventually gave in, embracing a candidate that was everything he told his supporters to fight against. 


I seriously looked into voting third party for two reasons:

1. My state has never NOT voted for a Dem in the last 40 plus years in the general election. So my vote wouldn't make a dent since it was nowhere near being a swing state.

2. I wanted the creation of a future third party. More ideas circulating could be good for US politics.


My friend woke me up by showing me how there was a massive globalist agenda being pushed by crooked politicians. I voted my conscious to try to give a candidate the best chance possible to protect US interests. Ultimately, I have been happy with the sitting president and I think the US is on the right track to protect its citizen's interests and the US Constitution. Why I walked away
MagaMan001142 Backstory: I was always more of a centrist than anything. Originally back in 2015 I thought that Bernie sanders could shake things up. Soon found that he was peddling bogus dreams. We don't have the money to do what he wanted to do. And I like capitalism myself anyways.

I was never a republican. I didn't care for. MCCAIN OR ROMNEY. I didn't like Obama either... I guess I just disliked Obama a bit less. But they were all bullshit artists.

2016, and now I'm following Trump. My first federal election. I introduced my parents to Trumps policy and ideas, and they soon became supporters with me... Along with my brother, and his girlfriend who once hated trump. My NY family is mainly made up of Trump supporters.

At first, him announcing his run for presidency seemed laughable. It soon proved to be a true movement in society.

In my opinion, the presidential candidates that are fought the hardest by the others and society, have the highest likely hood of winning, so long as they do not concede, ever... And always fight back for the wins.

It wasn't that I walked away.... It's that their hatred and unwillingness to logically and humanely discuss ideas has seemed to dissappear.  Young man from NY who walked away.
gcliff I'm not down with that shit. I walked away because even though I'm not white, my FB feed is full of people hating on my white people.
Zerogravitycrayon ShareBlue is enjoying chasing what they consider their human property across subreddit lines. Almost like it's 1860s all over again. Enjoying the Chase?
AndIAmEric It’s the party of oppression, the party of fear. Fear for a greater America. Fear that we cannot all live equal under our First Amendment rights. 

Yes, I was a strong supporter of this party in the past. But I just can’t sit idly by while I watch it desperately scramble at every turn to regain power as a dying party. It’s embarrassing. They are trying to silence us, oppress us. They’re media is feeding us lies everyday.

This is why I’m leaving the Republican Party.  My #WalkAway story
shitbecopacetic You expect me to be embarrassed enough by liberal propaganda that i suddenly stop thinking abortion is ok, stop wanting to tax the wealthy, &amp; start trying to put Christianity in schools or something? We didn’t arbitrarily pick a color we like, the parties are based on our views as people. I’m not going to see an extreme feminist running around naked  in the streets with some weird sign and suddenly adjust all my morals to be republican. It doesn’t make sense at all. So you expect...
hamshackles I voted for Kerry and Obama (in 2008).  I even cried while shaking Obama's hand during the 2008 primaries because I was so excited and overcome with hope.  My family is very connected to the Obamas and the Democrat Party, so much so that you wouldn't believe I would ever Walk Away. 

I watched as Obama paraded around the world apologizing for America.  I watched as he won the Nobel Peace Prize for nothing.  I watched as he got us into more military conflicts and more of our brave young soldiers died in the Middle East to enrich political and corporate interests.

I Walked Away during Obama's first term and have never looked back.

To all the leftists shills brigading this sub...you all are so brainwashed by your cult that you can't even see you are proving to everyone the validity of this movement.  Thank you for your blind ignorance and self-righteous hubris.   Former Democrat voter with family who worked in the Obama DOJ here...
ArchetypalSage7 I'm a duel citizen. I live half the year in Canada and the other half in the US and I chose to #walkaway from both the Liberal Party in Canada and the Democratic Party in the US.   


The straw that broke the camels back for me was after the Humboldt Broncos Tragedy that killed 16 young hockey players, coaches, and staff, a Canadian Journalist [tweeted](https://briarpatchmagazine.com/images/made/varimages/articles/_resized/Nora2_639_718_90.jpg) that the only reason people cared were because the victims were young white males. I couldn't believe that this journalist was willing to stand on the graves of these young souls to make a point about white privilege.   


But it didn't stop there. There was obviously a huge backlash to the tweets on social media, but a few days later CBC the Canadian Public Broadcaster came to the journalists defence. The broadcasting corporation we subsidize with billions of tax dollars decided to have a panel where they actually [defended](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnKxTZ6mta8) this woman and her tweets. I knew the CBC had turned into the propaganda arm for the liberal government but watching them defend this awful extremist journalist made me sick. One of the panelists starting talking about how we live in a white supremacist society and I couldn't believe they would air these racist, far left viewpoints. Later on they even brought the journalist on the CBC and gave her a platform to talk about white privilege.  


Recently in the US, you're seeing similar behaviour from the democratic party. I thoroughly believe that the left has become racist against white people, sexist against men, and completely intolerant of centrist and conservative viewpoints. I'll be voting for Andrew Scheer and for Donald J Trump moving forward and I suggest that others #WalkAway from the left too.  
 My #Walkaway Moment (Duel Citizen)
Cryptic99 The democrats crazy far left views pushed me away. Caring about illegals entering our country more than our own poor. Worrying about what gender you are instead of enforcing basic rights. The list can go on and on. They've lost all touch on reality an have gone off the hinges so I voted for Trump in 2016 with no regrets. Since he's doing an amazing job I'll be voting for him again in 2020.  I was Center left walked away a few years ago after voting for Obama in 2008
truthspeaker312 Who are the violent fascists?  I cannot wear a MAGA hat without fear of attack. This is why I #walkaway
seanpeery Literally, this is just the RedPill movement again. Which if you have to do it again, implies that it completely failed to achieve its goal.

I'm pretty sure very few in this group genuinely believes anything different than they did prior. They just want to rant about how their political opponents constantly make them feel like shit.

So this is far worse than RedPill because at least they seemed to have a political goal of enlightening people to the problems overlooked or even generated by extreme left ideas, where as this is just a giant circle jerk of how oppressed already right leaning people feel when they try to act like they support left ideology. So this is a shitty version of RedPill?
Reptilian_Overlords Now I’m a Communist.

Still don’t like Republicans nor would I ever vote for one. I walked away from Democrats...
supershitposting Because if you disagree with something Democrats do, especially on Reddit, they call you a Russian bot. Why people I know #Ranaway
agrafes And the censorship of the MSM and Internet space against pro-nationalist &amp; pro-America ideas has to stop. They are losing the ideology war and this is the turning of the tide. #WalkAway. The DNC was a setup, the real collusion was Uranium One, and I'm tired of our country being at war all the time. I voted Obama both times, but it's time to #WalkAway.
Exxonteric Both major parties have histories of stunning betrayals of their bases.  I think a part of the #WalkAway movement is walking away from the political establishment as well as a system which denies most the opportunity to remove an incumbent when it has become clear that he or she lied to get elected. Some thought should be given to what #WalkAway is walking toward.
Beardo_Brian They're downvoting an entire sub's content into the 40-50% range while accusing anyone who criticizes the Dems of being liars and even Russian bots...because they can't believe people would want to get away from them.      
That's some weird rage, take a nap fellas. These downvote mobs are hilarious

 Let’s walkaway!
ireaditonwikipedia I used to be a leftist but then someone insulted me on the internet and I decided to completely switch all my political views because that's how rational human beings work.

And then... wait. 

Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is this subreddit all T_D posters pretending to be liberals? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe that Reddit is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Steve Huffamn to be the moderator and fix this broken subreddit. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought everyone was changing their views because of a YouTube video???? This is so fucked.  Proud to join this movement
yu658lkgf Lying about and disparaging others is EXACTLY what caused the biggest political upset ever, so everyone should take their insults as a compliment, it's as though they're admitting that they want to lose even harder...so do your thing you crazy communists.  Lol, insane trolls still calling everyone Russians??
sobersally The left cannot allow opposing viewpoint to be heard.  Do yourself a favor and go to "popular" and sort by controversial of the last 24 hours. 99% of links are r/walkaway. We are under a serious downvote brigade.
JustCantStopWinning I was like many other college students - an idealist hippy with zero grasp of the real world.  I spent my days smoking the devil’s lettuce, playing JRPG’s, and posting on beta subreddits like r/politics and r/SubredditDrama. I regret to inform you that I voted for Barry TWICE.  8 years later I was working at a dead end job with no gf, despite being a staunch feminist.  

That’s when the Demoncrats nominated Hillary Clinton (blech!) for the highest office in the land.  I looked at my sad life, what the Democrats had done for me, and realized something needed to change.  I needed to win.  That’s when I #walkaway’d and voted for Donald J. Trump.  

Nearly two years later, I am a completely different man.  I work out and slam puss on the reg. I moved to a better job and drive a Camaro.  I grew a full beard (never could when I was a dem).  And most importantly, I don’t post on those beta subs anymore.  Occasionally, in between puss slam sessions, I browse them while sipping whiskey and chuckle at the beta I used to be.

God Bless America  How I turned my life around by becoming conservative
GiantRephaim Here's a sub where people share their story of waking up, or being red pilled, which is similar to the walkaway movement as well. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatWasYourRedPill/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatWasYourRedPill/) Walkaway and red pill sub
godsdragon79 Furthermore, even if you proved your point, who would you have outsmarted or defeated in the outcome? Lets play this out logically (please hold any REEEEES until the end of the class please).

Option A) Nobody has walked away and it's all lies from Russian Robots. So you post several comments asserting this to be fact and it turns out that the only ones seeing your hard work are robots. How is this a win? Is this somehow going to convince Republicans to reject reality or cause Democrats to get more votes at midterms? Nope. Complete waste of time. So why bother? Logical conclusion is you know it's real and you are trying to keep more people from joining the movement by convincing them it doesn't exist, which simply won't work.

Option B) The people are real and the bots are bogus and you just look like an ignorant libpuppet. Again, why bother? You do more harm than good for your cause.

Please, educate me. What positive effect comes from fighting a movement you think is fake?
 Just curious... if the #walkaway movement is fake and the over 106,000 verified human beings were actually russian bots then why waste so much time and effort attacking and attempting to discredit people who are walking away? Wouldn't that mean you are arguing with bots?
jesuss_son If you think this is all a bad idea, why not let it fail on its own merit,? Why waste your time?

If you think only idiots can fall for this movement, again why not just let them be? Why do you feel the need to come say what supposedly everyone knows and call the movement fake?

Enlighten me

t. t_d poster Question for the shills who come to Brigade or discredit this obvious growing movement..
MEDICARE_FOR_ALL Which democratic politicians did you vote for?

Did you vote for Trump? Who here is actually registered as a Democrat?
Adam__Warlock trump is also garbage. i'll walk away, but give me a place that makes sense. (and isn't ban crazy)
 ok. fuck the dnc. now what?
Encoresway Background: I used to be a 24 year old Democrat Dr working for big pharma. Then one day I got a rare type of ass cancer, on my death bed I made one final plea to God to heal my suffering and out came Donald Trump. I could see his muscles tense from carrying all of these illegals out of my country. He gave me an impish look and brushed my hair aside, "make America great with me?" He said rubbing his normal sized hands down my shirt. "Y-yes ," I said stuttering and out of breath. And just like that he carried me off into the moonlight, which we made love 72 times under

Make America great again. Brothers and sisters. I am proud to say as a former Democrat that I have renounced the evil globalist agenda and have seen the light. MAGA!!
Youcannotsucceed Hey guys, 

I only found this sub because of the brigading happening. I voted for Obama first term, donated to  Elizabeth Warren even though I lived way away, and generally believed in the Democratic party until Obama disillusioned me. Even worse was when I realized suddenly saying and believing "America First" was tantamount to a hate crime. Why is it wrong for me to want the best for my people?

We aren't bots, though I personally think we should adopt it as the new moniker. 

I love you bots. Subscribed and happy to be here.  Long time Democrat, Forever Trump

That wife ain't doing shit Gays for Donald Trump
DontCareJustDont It's a doosey but I had a fight with my ex-gf about trump and was crazy about how he was somehow the worst. In my mind he represented everything wrong with America even though he, of course, came on the back end of all of that. Anyway I was suuuper pissed. Blah blah blah we broke up, I left my college to join the military which I'm doing right now. But I got slightly repilled by a video of Trump right after 9/11 where he was saying, "there's no way that building fell down, it looks like bombs. I worked with the guy who built that building and there's no way it came down like that". He was an outsider but I was still skeptical. Then, I knew about this sub. Knew it was faux-pas. Pretty tantalizing cuz I'm a conspiracy theorist (normal person) at heart. I started seeing SJW-owned compilations on youtube and I literally was looking in a mirror to how nonsensical I was. I always envied people who could talk at length about politics and they always seemed to be republicans. So after video after video I laughed, was introduced to KEK. Love that guy. The lore, the memes, the consistency. I absolutely knew Donald Trump was the next redpill but I was scared as hell to like him. Then the final redpill that got me to T_D was the news saying T_D would never get to 500,000 and when you guys passed it I grabbed my nuts and looked up, "All the racist things Trump has said" and the video was absolute shit. Everything was just some instance of him mentioning race. Most of it, I shit you not, was him saying, "the mexicans love me" or, "I know asian businessmen, I might be the best asian businessman there ever was". I was like this has to be a joke. And ever since I've been led into this world of self-accountability and responsibility. I'm not the best but when that happened I got two jobs, a gym subscription, started "cleaning my room" and everything.

In hindsight, even though I never felt comfortable around my ex-gf I got the knowledge that that reason was because I had a deep victim mentality. Everyone was against me. She was a biiiig booty white girl too. I mean, instagram booty. But I didn't love her, it was lust. Either way, me looking like an idiot about Trump was the best thing that ever happened to me.

TL;DR: I redpilled myself?

Printedinusa If everyone in this sub is a former liberal, then surely we all understand that the hatred from the right is just as disgusting as (if not more than) that of the left. Does this sub, then, promote a third party? Or complete abstinence from government of all kind? Because surely anybody present who inscribed to the ideologies of any mainstream political party has wound up in the wrong sub. Honest question: Shouldn’t this movement support walking away from both the liberal and conservative mainstream parties?
WalkAwayFromtheRight I don't understand why everyone in this sub is so worried about downvotes.

If the movement is real, and actually has substance, people will come here and participate.

It's literally imaginary points. I would think that if people are actually walking away, they wouldn't be swayed by that. Why are you all so obsessed with downvotes?
JacobMittensSmith I’m an 18 yr old American. I was a proud democrat who hated the Republican Party and the disgusting scandals that constantly came from its leaders. I was a devout follower until my eyes were opened to the extremes of political correctness and the socialist movement in America. The extremes were repulsive. I realized that my peers could be extremely lazy, demanding, inconsiderate, overly sensitive and petulant. Many of my peers value their own emotions more than the freedom of others. One thing I’ve always believed is that freedom is the most important value. Freedom is what empowers and protects people. Freedom is what people are always protesting for more of in other countries, yet here in America there is a movement to restrict freedom. It’s blatantly obvious that the issue is not a physical thing, it’s an ideology that is plaguing my generation. It’s an ideology that this nation battled for the majority of the 20th century. It’s the socialist ideology. The ideology that spits in the face of individuality. The ideology hates self empowerment, self expression, and individual freedoms. Every time the socialist/communist movement gains power over a nation, the citizens of that nation inevitably lose their individuality. Now the socialist movement is corrupting the Democratic Party. The socialist party could potentially become the 3rd major official party of America. The libertarian party is the opposite of this evil party. It values individuality. It’s political views are welcoming to both democrats and republicans.  Ben Shapiro, a republican registered libertarian, showed me the values that make libertarianism so great. And now I’m a libertarian. I believe the best way to keep America #1 is to counter this socialist movement with a libertarian movement. #walkaway #formerdemocrat #neversocialism Dem-&gt;Lib
TheFunnyShah This subreddit is a very funny joke. I'm going to be walking away from this place and over to /r/adviceanimals.

I'm going to pour out some Stolichnaya for you all. Have  a good day. Hope you don't get Novichok'd. You guys can't be serious.
EngiNERD1988 I voted for Obama the last two elections.

I did vote for trump (but i hated him at the time ALMOST as much a hillary) while doing it

But now that ive seen how much hate the left has, i know i made the right decision and will likely vote R for the rest of my life. (unless somthing drastic changes)

The perfect example of this hate is the current lefties coming here to downvote my opinion.

This sub was made for people like me to talk to other like-minded people about why we left the party of Identity politcs and hate.  

but what has it become aready? Non-stop angry lefties going out of their way to harrass people with different points of view (big suprise)

The funny part is, THIS exact behavior is why i know i made the correct decision. and i honestly feel they dont understand this.

So go ahead and down-vote me lefites who cant handle people who have different points of view as them) LOL

You are your own worst nightmare, you just dont know it yet.  I Walked Away
jshow403 Hi All,

Would just like to state that I walked away #walkaway. I'm so sick of the hypocrites finger pointing. One thing I did notice, (which woke me the heck up) those who usually point fingers are typically the ones committing those actions. I'm at a loss of how racist and deranged the left has become. It's so sickening because THEY HIDE IT, and will pretend to be your friend to your face to only hate your guts a different day in secret.

These clowns are trying to start a civil war now. I wont fight for you, with you or against you. I'll just straight up hug you until you learn to accept EVERYONE.

I voted for Obama, and instantly regretted it by his actions against Israel and appeasement to the mullah's. I'd also like to state me entire family has also #walkaway. Not a single registered democrat left and we're voting Trump 2020.

As someone who works in NYC - I'm proud to say I saw A LOT of people rocking the #walkaway shirt, I was actually in shock to see this happen in such a liberal city. Regardless of where you stand, I just want you all to know I accept you. I may not agree with you, but I sure as heck wont hate you for it. Former Democrat, and Legal Immigrant
vanulovesyou I understand why some Democrats may be unhappy, I didn't vote for the party in 2016, but it is obvious that much of this so-called "movement" is simply the Republicans trying to increase their party's power by exploiting the anger of people they have long called "communists" and "un-American." 

After all, anyone who actually supports Democratic policies, such as universal health care, public education, environmentalism, fair wages, etc., isn't going to find a home with the Republican party, who will ultimately trying to undermine, even destroy, anything that would have made you a Democratic or liberal in the first place.

That's why the conservative interest in #walkaway is inauthentic because these are the same people who have long despised liberals or Democratics, and their only concern is trying to destroy the Democratic opposition so they can have one-party rule. 

They may want to hear your "story" now, but they'd go back to hating you in an instant if you decided to vote Democratic again.  Walkaway to what -- the same bad Republican policies as before?
OldGuyWhoSitsInFront Flaired Never Socialism because I don’t want socialism. I want social democracy. Learn the difference and you’ll find out you’d be down with it if it didn’t also benefit people of color you traitorous racist piles of garbage. You guys are hilarious because those of you who aren’t Russian or Bot accounts have had your viewpoints co-opted by Russian and Bot accounts. Fucking suckers.
TheLowClassics I am I welcome here? I don’t like trump, but I dislike Schumer pelosi and Hillary even more. 

I walked away from the dems a couple years ago, I’m not turning red tho. Are folks like me welcome here? Do you have to like trump to walk away ?
whothinksmestinks 1. Naturalized Citizen. Happily paid my taxes as my contributions to the country I love, never took a dime of welfare money.
2. In liberal parlance, I am person of color.
3. Registered to vote with Democratic Party affiliation
4. Voted twice for Obama. Volunteered for Obama. Donated to his campaigns.
5. Donated to various Democratic candidates e.g. senate races, in my state, and in other states.
6. Donated to NPR, ALCU and Planned Parenthood
7. Wanted Elizabeth Warren to be first female President
8. Donated to Bernie Sanders campaign, volunteered for Bernie.
9. Was angry that Cecile Richards donated 20 million to Hillary, IN THE PRIMARIES!!!
10. I was Bernie or Donald guy. Check the subreddits I created in 2016. I saw Bernie or Donald as two different methods of making American people's life better. You can check my comment history.
11. Bernie sat down to protest with Verizon employees and accomplished nothing. Trump talked with CEOs of Ford and Carrier and threatened them with tariffs. I realized which way was going to work in real life, it was Trump's method.
12. And then Bernie folded at DNC convention.

Till DNC convention, I supported both, Bernie or Trump, I would have been happy with either one. After the convention, I realized that I was wrong in supporting Bernie. Trump was the true way to get what I wanted, I voted for Trump and did all that I could to change the people I know to vote for Trump. It has been fabulous two years of Trump presidency. The way Trump destroyed the Clinton-Bush dynasty, the way he destroyed the old never-Trump NeoCon's GOP, is beautiful to watch. 

I love my country and I love my President. MAGA! I walked away in 2016 and voted for Trump
GiantRephaim Please check out all the links I provide, they are essential to understand how complex this is.

Some people may not know that Donald Trump at one time was a democrat who walked away. Before running for president he was fairly popular to an extent, although he was just a businessman, but even the rap community looked up to him as something to achieve. Then once he ran for president against the democrats, he was immediately branded a basic deplorable. Everything Hillary called the American people who supported Trump. Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic etc. Here's her BS claim on all of us deplorable sitting around in a big basket:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCHJVE9trSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCHJVE9trSM)

Trump saw how the democrats went against common sense, and had to run as a republican, because the left had taken over the DNC. He was also asked to run by military intel years ago, as they didn't want Clinton's corruption along the establishment plan to destroy America. This came out from state department former CIA Steve Piezcenick before the election about the counter coup by three letter agencies in the US to give info to wikileaks to spread the info over the internet:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov5kvWSz5LM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov5kvWSz5LM)

The reason military intel had to step in was because the corruption was so bad, something I've been looking into for 17 years now, and this walk away movement is also part of the great awakening movement, of people simply waking up, and realizing they were bamboozled like a common schmuck.

This is the next phase of this plan of the walk away. This is a must watch, even though many people may not be ready for it, finding out how bad the corruption actually is, that's what they call the red pill. Once you learn it, you can't unlearn it, and then you wake up fully and want to fight for our future:

We will take back our freedom. Don't be afraid to stand up, the time is now. The ultimate walk away- Donald Trump was once a democrat who walked away
jesuss_son Only rural and suburban retards voted for Trump. City people voted for Hillary  Just so you guys know
TrumpBot070 I believe in public lands, national parks, economic growth with regulation on banks, environmental regulations, the right to seek asylum, gay rights and stopping the drug war.

While I know Dems won't end the drug war thanks to corporate donors, they will however not vote for destrcution of public lands by selling them to oil tycoons, cull social security, Medicare and CHP+, nor will they put people like Scott Pruitt or Betsy DeVos in charge of departments they want to end. 

Change my view. I hate the DNC, but I see no reason to vote against them right now. I walked away from both parties, but will still vote Dem in 2018. CMV.
AmycusLoL Unabashedly Democratic for my whole life. I just was pointed here from a post on r/all and reading around. One thing that would jump right out at me with a movement like this would be an impartial moderation/leadership team, or a newly converted one. However, over half the moderators are active posters of The_Donald/Conservative/Libertarian/NewRight. If this subreddit is centered around the idea of walking away from the Democratic party, the idea of the moderation team being majority posters with a history from non-left leaning subreddits already seems a bit disingenuous, no? I would think the moderators would be more likely have a post history in line with this mentality change, but I can't for the life of me find anything truly supporting this. There's nothing wrong with whichever party you choose to support, but if you have a standing history of supporting one party over the other, and claim it's a grassroots movement...how is that not blatant astroturfing?  This subreddit feels like astroturfing...

fiftyfootwall Greetings, Patriots... 


I'd like to add to the revelry with my ***Walkaway*** story:


I was raised as a Democrat, with very single member of my living family voting, rallying and volunteering for Democrat candidates. 
My father was a union laborer, my mother a social worker... in my youth it was a given that our family always voted for democrat candidates. I was taught, by my parents, to scorn conservative views... because at the end of the day, "it could cost us our jobs".


Our family had conservative friends, but it was always known to me post-fact that they were conservative or Republican... not to be trusted. 


A friend of my sisters recommended this website to me back in 2006. I lurked, I joined, I participated in redacted on my main account for what is now 11 years. In that time, I voted for Ron Paul once, Obama twice and Bernie Sanders in the primary.


[When it was revealed that he gave the majority of his grassroots donations to large corporations, I was done.](http://fortune.com/2016/05/12/bernie-sanders-fundraising-donations-spent/) 


**Completely and utterly done.** 


After you dissolve the shit the media tells you, Trump is a genuine person. He is fighting for every American. Does he fight for large companies? Sure… but that strengthens the American economy. Large Corporations have been leaving the USA in droves due to shit policies and shit bloated regulation used to keep Democrats in government positions. Now I spend my time annihilating liberals on redacted and educating my friends and family on political issues.


I am a socially-liberal, fiscally-conservative independent voter, who is rejected by the left and scorned by the establishment right. 


I am a Trump supporter, I am deplorable.
 Nothing ruins the redacted party like an informed voter... my Walkaway Story
The_Bug_Lord ALERT! RUSSIAN SPY DETECTED! OMG, HE'S A RUSSIAN SPY
bigoldgeek Because "walkaway" isn't bad English to start with. Seriously how dumb do you think people are? Yes. Are Democrat. Is not Russian troll. Walkaway.
doooooooomed Chill out, go for a walk. Enjoy nature. Talk to anybody about anything other than politics.

Y'all so angry, it isn't good for you. Stress will put you in an early grave and cloud your judgement. Go for a walk
digoryk I'm a life long conservative Christian, I love the unborn and the bill of rights. But Trump is nothing like what I signed up for, he attacked most of the bill of rights during his campaign and exemplified the seven deadly sins. But I won't give up my conservative identity. Our movement will outlast trump. In a few years he will be a distant memory and the excellent justices he appointed will be his only lasting legacy. The republican party will return to compassionate conservatism, and if it does not, I will walk away. Trump is tempting me to #walkaway from conservatism, but I won't
myg0dd Just sort by controversial on r/all. Tons of r/walkaway posts, and every r/politics, r/news. r/worldnews propaganda submission is being bombarded with detractors. &gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/8y2h77/liberal_utopia_vs_conservative_utopia/?sort=controversial

Redditdude45 Just wanted to say, not dissing people for being underage, we were all teenage anarchists at one point or another in our lives. But I think people often underestimate how much of a given opposition to internet-based movements are actually just armchair politicians not even old enough to vote yet. I mean, I know plenty of people who were. Its easy to jump on a political bandwagon when you're young to champion it on the Internet. That's the way I see most modern Democrats online. They're just kids who don't know any better and see the whole world as black and white ("all Republicans and Trump supporters are Nazis and real life is just like my favorite movies!"). Remember guys this is Reddit where the most interaction people have with real political issues are what breed of dog is in a gif on r/aww. Just some thoughts. Don't get mad over them. They'll grow up someday and realize. Remember, we're walking away, not getting angry. How many people downvoting this sub and are still "Dems" actually just kids?
MAGALibcucks but that's not the case anymore, I saw that they weren't looking out for me, and then seeing how poorly they took the loss in 2016 fueled me, I needed to get out. I couldn't in good conciounce vote for hillary, so I voted Trump begrudgingly, but after seeing what he's done for us, and all he's done to MAGA I will happily be voting for him again in 2020. \#WalkAway I USED to call myself a democrat.
Adiospelota21 As an Asian-American who spends time in both California and Toronto (ideological shitholes), my #walkaway started in 2016 prior to the election. Violence in the months leading up to the election led me to investigate who was being attacked and who was doing the attacking. I was apolitical at the time, yet I could still clearly remember the instance I questioned why the department heads at my college were old and white. How lucky I was to not have gone down the rabbit hole. To this day, I still thank the Democrats who perpetrated violence against Trump supporters for my turnaround. Their senseless violence and ludicrous justifications opened my eyes to what people were capable of when they stand to lose a lot ideologically. The cornered beast lashes out, always. Below I want to point out a few reasons why Asian-Americans should consider #walkingaway before it’s too late. 

1. The Democratic minions you see on the streets harassing ordinary citizens going about their business are basically acting like the Red Guards. Except of course, in the United States. The Red Guards are alive and well. They use the same tactics. I suppose you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. Da zi bao (posters), pi dou (struggle sessions) in universities, senseless street harassment of ordinary citizens and elected officials, same shit. What they lack in the force of arms and government backing is doubled in media propaganda. These tactics are only employed when a group is very very desperate to control the narrative. A narrative that stands on weak legs and is only retainable by force. We saw this during the Cultural Revolution and we see this now. The end result will be the same as what happened in China, a big fat red pill for the (un)silent majority. But at what cost…? 

2. What we value in Chinese (and similar cultures in Asia) and American culture is inherently incompatible with the regressive values preached by these ideological thugs. Meritocracy and hard work is dismissed as a tool of the oppressive white supremacy. The nuclear family and virtues of filial piety are dismissed as weapons of the hetero-patriarchy. Capitalism is fucking evil. Countless hours of blood and sweat, and stinginess beyond imagination is outdone by just as many hours of virtue signalling and demands for reparations. Cultural relativism and the empty vessel of inclusiveness outweighs logic and reason. Import the third world, you get third world. The Asians abroad get this. There is a reason why countries like China and Japan actually have heavily vetted borders….

3. We are next. Once these regressive are done with “cis white scum” we are next. All these light-skinned white-washed Asians who are so tone deaf to systemic racism (yet we still succeed LOL) are PART OF THE PROBLEM. They’re right. We are part of the problem because they can’t enslave us on plantations like they do to African-American folks. They can’t abuse us for cheap labor like the Latino folks. That’s a huge problem, ain’t it. 

I’m choosing to #walkaway because when the time comes for them to attack me I won’t be backstabbed, I won’t be duped. I will be standing on the other side, staring the right in the god damned eye. Wide awake. #walkaway while you can, my fellow Asian-Americans. #walkaway  #WalkAway Asian Americans - Some Thoughts
Gasonfires This entire sub is a lie, just like everything that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth. This sub is the most obvious, blatant fraud I've seen in years. Ban me and I'll wear it as a badge of honor.
Le_Monade I used to be a libtard until I realized that I actually was brainwashed by the mainstream media. I was recently red pilled and found out that actually they are only controlled by globalist Jews who want to steal all my tax dollars to give drugs to gay poor people. The final straw was when Ben Shapiro triggered a sjw with facts and logic and I realized that Democrats are the real racists.

TRUMP 2020 Make America great again!

#walkaway Why I walked away
SensibleVotingNC I have alligned with the democrats, but am tired of the identity politics in general. How do I walk away if I still hold values that align with democrats? Is it a matter of just trying to be objective? I want to try and be more unbiased, but I don't know where to start. How do I walk away?
yosif_ Disclaimer: I identify as moderately liberal with some conservative ideologies. I don't plan on changing that any time soon.

Before I receive downvotes or a sudden ban, please hear my story.

My name is Juan.

My parents were born and raised in León, Guanajuato, México. Shortly after they were married and expecting a child in the early 90s, their neighborhood was under attack. The cartel, or at least people involved with some form of criminal behavior, were in a shootout with the local police. Crime was prevalent in their neighborhood, but this was the first time people were under fire. When everything was clear, several people were carried out in body bags, including innocent women and children.

My parents talked about one day going to America to seek greater opportunities, but this incident cemented their decision. They joined a caravan along with several other members of my family. They eventually crossed the border through Southern California.

After my brother was born and my dad provided for his family via several odd jobs, he decided to apply for asylum. He was told that he and his family could receive naturalized citizenship after some time. My family was accepted and we moved to Idaho.

My dad worked his way up at Union Pacific while my mom raised four children at home.

My oldest brother graduated with a bachelor's degree in Music Education. He now gives private lessons for tuba, works as a teachers assistant at a local high school, and performs all over the Treasure Valley. He hopes to one day work permanently for a prominent Orchestra or other ensamble.

My next oldest brother graduated with an associates degree in 3D Art. He has since moved to California and now works at Insomniac Games. He is currently working hard on the new Spiderman game.

My younger sister is currently in middle school. She gets good enough grades, but her heart is truly set on dancing. I'm currently dreading the day she starts dating.

As for me, I'm currently studying computer science at Boise State. I hope to one day work as a software developer for a video game studio.

--- Here comes the controversial part ---

Why on earth would I ever #WalkAway?

Everything good in my life was achieved because of my parents' abilities to seek asylum in the United States after crossing the border. We were given citizenship because the government at the time saw us as potential citizens that would only benefit our society.

Had 2018's immigration laws been applied, my parents would have never become United States citizens. They would have likely stayed in México where the cartel controlled the day-to-day operations of their city. My brother's music career would have never taken off because he would have been trapped in a cage and separated from my parents. Hell, I probably would have never been born in the first place.

------

So there's my spiel. I'm not trying to intentionally troll this movement. I am GENUINELY curious as to why frequenters of r / td believe that someone with my history should #WalkAway.

I have to admit, I'm not 100% on board with the Democrat party. However, I choose the greater of two evils, seeing that the current Republican party apposes everything me and my family has ever stood for, currently stands for, and will ever stand for. The moment I #WalkAway is the moment I destroy the foundation of my entire life.
Workingthatwagon At the beginning of the last election I was just left of center. After seeing what the left has become I'm walking far far away. Any opinion opposing their views is now suppressed which is more fascist than anything I've seen the right do. Not to mention all the hate speech they use against their opposition or the physical attacks on Trump supporters. I believe America should be first and all I see is the left trying to destroy our relationships with each other as Americans. There's never any constructive discussion, it's all just about how bad Trump and his supporters are. I've seen fact after fact showing America is currently on the right path yet somehow this equates half the country being racist, xenophobic, bigots, etc. I really wish I had never done the research. But I did...that's why I'm walking away.  I'm walking away.
MaximumHistory After spending thirty years of my life in this party that I once loved, I have chosen to walk away. They once fought for my freedom and liberty, but now, they have been reduced to identity politics and mindless buzzwords. Our candidate in the last election was a corrupt disgrace and has embarrassed me as a lifelong member of this party. 

That's right. I've chosen to walk away from the Republican Party and become a Democrat.  Walking away...
foodfyte I was struck by a recent meme of a guy crying over a liberal "leaving the plantation" and it occurred to me that both parties are to blame. They are both plantations! The Democratic party and GOP will do battle until then end of time and FOREVER tear America apart. We don't even need Russian bots to do it for us! Our blind party loyalty to the Republican and Democratic parties brought us here, to this moment, where we are playing directly into the hands of those who wish to see us divided.

But let me ask this community, if we #walkaway from two-party politics, what do we #comeback to?

I'd like to advocate that we Americans come back to LOVE, for one another, regardless of party affiliation and our differences. Come back to TOLERANCE, of each other's ideas so that we may have an actual dialogue without hate or punishment. Come back to EMPATHY. Because I am f***ing tired of hearing that we can't support each other because of politics. Democrats and Republicans unite! Walk away from the American two-party system!
MrPete001 I’m so sick of being called a Russian bot anytime I criticize a democratic viewpoint. I kinda thought I was alone on Reddit as one of the only people who isn’t blindly following this slippery liberal rhetoric. 

Good to be here. Pumped I found this sub
pookiee68 I RAN away from the Communist Democrat party in 1980 when I helped throw Jimma Carter out of the White House by voting for Ronaldo Maximus, the greatest president in American history until Donald Trump, the NEW Greatest President to Ever Live. Fuck the Democrat party, now and forever. RUN, don't walk!
Grallllick ... When you consider that there are plenty of useful idiots who adore the Republican Party as it is. ;p The Russian Bot Theory Is Ridiculous...
iuopkizt I'm here from bannedfromrdonald which seems to be more bannedfromrwalkaway these days. I was searching for Russian bots but I can't find them. If any Russian bots are here please let me know, I'd like to talk.

In all seriousness though, is this a conservative sub? For example I care about climate change, diplomacy over brute force, functioning and well targeted social support structures etc, but I cant stand identity politics, prioritizing minorities over the majority (duh) and legally enforcing equality of outcomes. So at which point do you consider that someone has "walked away"? Like the idea in itself seems a bit caricatural, if you just walk away from the left to the right, unless I'm mistaken. Where do you walk away?
Draugur98 Prove me wrong lmao The entirety of this sub appears to be The Donald users LARPing as ex-democrats, and leftists taking the bait and getting mad about it.
TheGlassStone WalkAway is a sub dedicated to Democrats who feel left behind by their party’s identity politics and toxic violence. They can come here to share their stories and talk with others in the community.

This sub is NOT a debate group. This sub is not an invitation to people from r/politics and r/The_Donald to down vote each other and the members of this community into oblivion. Anyone who engages in uncivil behavior from either side will be permanently banned. Welcome to WalkAway
TrumpBot070 Obviously, if you're a former dem, you're not going to just abandon all liberal values to run to Trump or the GOP. So, I'm curious to hear what liberal ideals y'all still support? What do common liberal ideals do those who have walked away still support?

Capitalist_Korean This subreddit is fucked. Fuck you all. Y'all are so clearly from /r/The_Donald/, and just making a BS subreddit to make your BS political agenda seem just *that* much more proliferated throughout society.

If I haven't said it enough times already – fuck you all. Finally, a reasonable subreddit!
Adam__Warlock don't whine about free speech then sub and play in safe spaces. that's pussy shitflake shit. unban all non spammers if you believe in free speech. fight to ban saferbot and unban 99% of the bans over on the donald. fuck moderator planned safe space echo chambers. only cowards fear debate with opposing views. fight against safe spaces!
6ar6oyle Been a democrat for 10 years and have finally decided to...




Keep supporting democrats because at least they're not trying to literally destroy legit democracy here in the US like trump and the pathetic republicans who kneel to russia. Your attempts to weaken and divide the US won't work sorry. In the end democracy and common sense will prevail.

Anyway hurry up and ban me from this pathetic t_d bot infested sub lmao Wow you guys are right
geocyberrealist First off i'd like to thank u/TheGlassStone for un-banning me after having a lovely discussion on the rules of this sub. You are a gentleman and a scholar and I enjoyed our conversation, I hope your job moderating this sub becomes easier. 

I thought I should mention that there is a rule that isn't on the sidebar that the moderation team has informed me of.

u/TheGlassStone - My bans are for **accusations that can’t be proven**, excessive cursing, threats of violence, and shit posting.

Do which I asked "I can report posts that have accusations that can't be proven?"

u/TheGlassStone - "Yes you can."

So make sure you report any and all accusations that can't be proven in this sub, oh and of course the shit posting.  PSA: A rule not on the sidebar by u/TheGlassStone.
Lebensraum69 Who's with me? Proud to be a russian bot
ninjarager I called the democratic party home for so many years, but after various incidents of asinine behavior from the left I decided

SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2

supersupersupersuper SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2

shit

GAME OF THE YEAR SUPER MARIO  BROTHERS 2

SHIT My story.
jimboe1234 Not American so it doesn't apply to me but I was just wondering why people are "walking away" Can someone explain walkaway?
thefoamingpickle Tariffs are outdated and as we have a deficit of exports don't have as much leverage. Where's all the pro capitalists talking an honest look at this?  Where my free market peeps at criticizing this trade war?
Doolox What if I think the GOP represents such a significant threat to American democracy that voting for the only other alternative with a chance of defeating is the only option left?

I will happily walk away from the democratic party (already have to be honest) but not until after Trump is out of office. 

We at least need a sane Republican leader before walking away from the democrats. Without a viable third party, walking away from the democrats is pointless, isn't it?
godsdragon79 Ok. We all know the story. #walkaway is not real, russian bots, yadda yadda yadda. If this were true let me explain what would be happening:

1) Liberals would be doing absolutely nothing. If something is not a problem it does not require any attention. Nobody spends hours in front of a tire on a car trying to convince people that the tire isn't flat. It either is or it isn't. No intelligent person needs to be told what a fact is, they can see it for themselves, so why do so many liberals spend so much time downvoting and trolling something they believe to be fake and not an issue?

2) Republicans would be worried about midterms. They clearly aren't, and for good reason. Shit like this https://youtu.be/YaiPy_U6Uts has Democrats leaving the party in droves because it proves the point of the original #walkaway video.

3) Major Media would be commenting about it, and I don't mean Huffington. I'm talking CNN, the mother of all Trump Trashers. They reported stories about Russian Bots several months ago involved in gun control debate so why would they not mention them now? I will tell you why. It's because Fox News has featured Brandon Straka multiple times and presented iron clad evidence that the members of the #walkaway movement are real people. Launching a media campaign claiming Brandon to be a robot would only make them lose credibility. Since Huffington and Salon have never had any credibility to begin with they can afford to shitpost without a second thought. The final, clinching argument as to the validity of the #walkaway movement. Thanks Libs!
Kat_B0T Who told the democrat leaders that the base wants open borders and over all insane reactionary social policy. It’s like they get their directives from social media outrage. If they run any of the people they are considering now I will be voting for Trump. I doubt anyone from the DNC will see this post, but my disappointment is real and I am walking away until you are a viable option again which I hope is soon 🤞🏿  I voted Gore&gt;Kerry&gt;Obama&gt;Obama&gt;Clinton And today I’m saying enough is enough. Im gonna #walkaway and start voting for who ever I think is the best candidate.
birew34 I highly doubt any of you are actually democrats at all. Anyone who believes this sub is a complete fucking moron.
BronzedTwitler This subreddit claims to be inclusive and egalitarian. u/TheGlassStone appears to be the only moderator here who was actually trying to enforce that standard and was removed. Please explain why. Why Was u/TheGlassStone Removed as a Moderator?
FaDe_TNK Just a simple question, feel free to remove. Just curious as the sketchy website is the foundation of the left’s entire argument. How credible is Hamilton 68?
SlimDarkie Trump supporters, walk away before it’s too late...that is all. It’s time to walk away...
wwhyareyoulikethis Is there even a concise argument to the walkaway movement? 

Because it seems like a lot of it is just "democrats are bad! Don't believe their propaganda, believe **ours**! Don't jump on their bandwagon, jump on **ours**!" 

I just don't see much difference between what all groups are doing. And I'm honestly trying to look at this from an unbias view. 

Also, I kind of feel like this is all just something that's being really pushed to force/confuse intermediate-democrats into leaving the democratic party, just it time for voting season. Call me a "libtard" or "unaccepting" or whatever but it's just really convenient timing. 

**If anyone could explain this movement in a concise, (preferably unbiased) way, it would be very much appreciated. I'm honestly just trying to understand.** 

Also, sorry if I come off as bias in this post, I'm just so confused about all this. Every time I try to track down a consensus of #walkaway I just get really turned around. Some sources say it's about realizing the use of fear tactics (even though I thought that was pretty known and understood from both sides). Other sources say it's about propaganda and bandwagoning (even though, once again that's from all sides). Some say it's about patriotism (which is a such a blanket statement, generalizing so many people, I just can't see that being the reason for all this).  

Thanks Question, honestly curious, not bashing.

The #walkaway movement, a campaign highlighting alleged discord among the left, got a boost this week from accounts linked to Russian influence operations. The first use of the #walkaway hashtag from accounts monitored on Hamilton 68 was noted in early June (a few weeks after the grassroots campaign began), but engagement remained relatively low throughout the month. Activity spiked on July 2, when Hamilton 68 noted 73 unique tweets using #walkaway, and roughly another 50 using related campaign hashtags (e.g. #walkawaymovement). The late engagement suggests Kremlin-oriented accounts are trailers rather than leaders of the campaign, but the high-level of current engagement indicates an effort to astroturf support for the movement and hijack the narrative. This includes several monitored accounts that have changed their handles to include the hashtag, or that have shared their own supposed walkaway moments. The campaign also received a direct boost from Russian propaganda outlets RT and Sputnik, both of which ran stories on the movement. Glad I found you. Peace and love as you evolve.
i_dont_have-reddit Stop supporting Russian campaigns to divide and destabilize the United States Please, get some help.
Lostnumber07 I voted for Killary and used to be a democrat. I quickly became disillusioned when all the left did was attack everyone and never really stood for anything. Trump on the other hand has taken a firm stand on many things. Like getting hard anytime Putin calls him. His stance to fill the swamp so much it overflows and needs to be drained. Fighting the FBI after they have multiple indictments around people associated with Trump. Man I’m really glad I’ve walked away to TD2. Man democRATS suck.
thefoamingpickle I've searched mostly on Twitter and it's mostly "why aren't the dems running? Haven't they seen Hillary's kill count?" And "Leftists controlling the black vote #walkaway". None of this seems remotely sincere and it's just more of the same toxic politics that was witnessed during the 2016 elections. Oh my God, has this stuff never stopped?  The walkaway movement isn't led by disenfranchised dems, it's a failed recruitment tactic at best from people on the right. Change my mind. (Crowder drinking behind a desk)

Carniscrub That you completely change all your beliefs on morality because a political party that you used to identify with no longer represents what you thought it did? 

Wouldn’t an intelligent person still be liberal but side with a third party instead of the exact opposite party that you say you used to believe in? 

Psst literally everybody knows #walkaway is an idea only supported by complete morons that are Republican who are desperate to get less people voting Democrat because even though they’re stupid those liberals are dumber... or they’re too stupid to realize they are. 

You guys doing this prove that you don’t have too much confidence in trump on his own through his leadership skills.  What’s it like to be so weak
FiREtF Walk away and joins us over on the Left. We can vote for candidates against Russian election meddling and separating children from their families together. 

Plus you don’t have to pretend that Trump is a competent president anymore! What a relief that would be. Who here has #WalkedAway from the Right?
DrNoPants My freshman year of college I discovered libertarianism.  The notion that a man ought to be self reliant, entitled to nothing but the natural right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness seemed so obviously true to me.

I voted for Andre Marrou in 1992, and voted L where I could, otherwise voted R, since the GOP seemed to be the most inline with personal freedom.

Then something changed.

I saw more and republicans embracing the religious right, and turning away from reason.

Not just lying about science, but insisting that lies about science become policy.

From Global Warming, to Evolution, I saw the Republican party descend into christian dogma, and I did not see any real pushback from the Libertarians.

I left a lot of blank ballot spots in the 00's

Finally, in 2016, the Republicans assembles a clown car, and put the angriest, silliest, clown of all in the driver's seat.

On the Libertarian side, Gary "what is Aleppo" Johnson turned out to be equally feckless

I didn't leave the GOP, the GOP left me, and millions of others who believe in free markets, limited government and personal autonomy

#walkway

 My Journey
TheBlueCoyote Two years ago, I was a 185 pound veteran. But since Trump took over I've ballooned to 285 pounds! Mostly cheap pasta.  I'm growing a neckbeard now, and going for 300! Hope I fit in here!  Thank's Obama!   Thank's Donald!
brasiwsu I found this sub two or three days ago after watching a couple of the walkaway videos on youtube.  At first I kind of raced to sub here but I'm actually getting a little turned off with it.

Hopefully you hear me out and not just immediately write this off, so let give you a little background.  I am a sanders supporter who left the DNC when demexit became a thing, right after getting bent over in the democrat primaries by clinton and DWS and Loretta Lynch and all of them.  To them I'm just an idiot who fell for russian propaganda, julian assange is an enemy to our country and of course the VAST right wing consipracy against queen hillary.

When the CTR/shareblue shills took over reddit, I mostly only talked about politics in r/conspiracy, which is a playground for politics and topminds lowlifes.  I coexisted just fine with conservatives there, always supported them against the neoliberal brigades.  But politically, I supported things like democratic socialism, which is basically capitalism with govt healthcare, education, prison, anything with conflict of interest with the welfare of the people. 

I am pro 2nd amendment. I am pro free-speech. I am against citizens united. I am anti-war in the middle east, and financing 'moderate rebels' in foreign countries.  I think our fucking goverment can pass some immigration legistlation that we can all agree we'll enforce. I dont know, I think I am a reasonable person most of the time.

So I watch these two videos.  The guy Brandon Straka, and then I watched one from this lady Vanessa Berben. I thought, oh man, these guys are actually snapping out of it, they're progressives like me who are finally fed up with the democrats' manufactured resistance to trumps presidency and active efforts to suppress populist candidates in the democratic party.  At first, I thought the movement was dems walking away to go third party or something.

So I sub here and I start reading threads, I see the same desperate shills that brigade all over conspiracy and other subs and then I see a lot of people that are pro trump and thats cool too, I don't begrudge other people what their political choices are gonna be.  And i just hang out, downvoting trolls (you know the ones who just spend all day looking at post histories), reading the stories, that kind of thing.

I'm noticing though, there is a lot of anti-left stuff here.  It's not just anti DNC, you know? its stuff like "Progressive is a disease"  "The democrats are becoming socialist cancer" and shit like that.  Look, I am an actual progressive and I think antifa is a bunch of lunatics that are probably paid to show up. I'm not going to call you a russian or a literal nazi.  

If you left the dem party, you're cool with me.  If I'm cool with you, please dial it back and realize there are some rational people on the left that might be here, and we just want to coexist. Am I in the right sub?
BabylonTheGreatxs Yeah that is why the most important thing you can do is abandon political parties and encourage others to do so as well. At-least the ones we have.

Trump remember ran on grassroots. That's why he is doing so well he's only republican in association.

Remember both sides have to be in agreeance for anything to get done in congress. The real reason the immigration policy cant get fixed. Should #walkaway expand to both parties?
keggre I voted for Hillary in 2016 but now I'm having a lot of regrets. I really don't like the trade war Hillary is trying to start with Canada, and I'm also dissatisfied with how she dealt with Puerto Rico and the children being separated from their parents at the southern border. I'm definitely voting Trump in 2020, never again Hillary or any other Democrat. I voted for Hillary, but I wont ever vote for another democrat again.
Populistless My grandfather and half of his generation were killed by Nazis during World War II. My family hated fascism with a fiery passion, as did my country. But then the Soviet Union collapsed, and oligarchs took over much of the wealth. Alcoholism, suicide and domestic violence surged in the despair over the decline of our country. Finally a leader emerged. He didn't fix our public sector or heal our communities, he didn't make our country great again, he didn't bring free health care or quality education. But he did make us hate. He taught us to hate homosexuals so much that we would blame them for our problems. He distracted us by taunting the west. It didn't help our daily lives, or give us a future, but the hate and scraps of national pride via inferiority complex sustains us, gives us something to wake up to. I have sold out my grandfather, I have sold out our nation, I have allied myself with our the butchers of our homeland and supported neo-nazi groups in Russia. To pay for my daily bottle of vodka I wake up every day and pretend to be an American to stir shit on the internet. It's a pathetic life, but I get to feel like I'm a part of something. One day Russia... er um.. I mean the south... will rise again I was leftist because my family was
VapeNational I used to dislike Trump, but I have seen the light. Now I disagree with basic environmental science, post edgy frog memes on reddit, cut social contact with literally everyone at school, and think vaccination causes autism. God Im so enlightened and intellectual and totally not somebody who's been supporting Trump for years #walkaway #democratsmorelikedemonrats #globalwarmingisachinesehoax #makeamericavapeagain  My #walkaway story
yu658lkgf Hope everyone is ok, seems like they don't have too much ammo...some talk about how uneducated everyone in disagreement with them is, complaining about the rich or just a lot of childlike whining all in an attempt to make you feel 'less than', not to worry, communists/antifa are just losers who think that complete strangers owe them the things that they're too lazy to earn themselves...imagine that??  Really though, imagine something you want and now take it further(left)...describe the person who owes it to you and how you would go about deceiving them into buying it?...this is basically their whole degenerate existence

Anyway, have fun and keep on walking and if you have to...RUN Hey all, how are the trolls behaving?
UltraInstinct51 It has ranked as the third or fourth most popular Kremlin-linked hashtag for days, according to bot tracking by the Hamilton 68 site run by the bipartisan Alliance for Securing Democracy, which keeps tabs on Russian activity on the American internet.

Arc Digital has made the same connection in the “strikingly similar” tweets pushing a “familiar narrative” of Democratic “bullying.” Arc traced the campaign from a Facebook group in May and subsequent tweets whose traffic suddenly began to explode late last month. Russian Bots are back
temujin1234 Walk towards an autocrat.  No thanks.

Would you support someone dismissing both Democrats and Donald? C'mon, you all really mean walktowards.
Happymuffn ...but I'm not sure exactly what that means. I am fine saying screw the Democratic party. All the feminism is giving me cancer, all the news is either biased or ignored, and you can't point any of it out without fear of being torn apart.

But I'm still on the left. I still think that improving government programs is the way to go and that the free market is going to fuck us if we let it. And as far as I can tell the identity politics on the right is as bad as it is on the left, just less... publicly supported. I am still going to vote for candidates more liberal than conservative, at least until the point where **they're** actually the ones calling to kill all men. As bad as the party is, I agree with their candidates more than I do the GOP's. It's like enjoying a game even though the fanbase is toxic. I can't call myself a fan anymore or else all the normal people look at me like I'm one of *those* people, but I still like the actual game.

And then I see you guys. It seems like most of you went all the way over to the right (not that I can blame you), all MAGA and Trump and all that. And of course all the news organizations are dismissing you as Russian bots. Because they're all hacks now.

But, given that you aren't actually bots I figured I'd just come and ask you what exactly it means to #walkaway. Do I just need to not be a democrat? Or stop being on the Left? or what? All I actually want is the ability to discuss policy in good faith. not calling people Nazis for disagreeing with anything. How far do you guys need me to walk away?

 I want to #walkaway
UltraInstinct51 The #walkaway movement, a campaign highlighting alleged discord among the left, got a boost this week from accounts linked to Russian influence operations.

pepsicancer Let’s tone down the shitposting a tad for actual conversation on the #walkaway movement. Not trying to brigade but I don’t want think this sub should just be T_D 2.0.

So to those who will inevitably comment here: Are you posting this as someone who walked away or as someone who’s still on the dems? Why are you here? 

I’m a T_D supporter and I want to hear what y’all have to say.

 This sub is a mix between the actual walkaway movement and the shitposters over on T_D.
PurplePineapple12 Also sucked into liberal harvey davidsom mc fans lol Cane farmers are not worried about being hit by trade tarrifs. They love trump. So if any complain they are democrats crisis actors
PMme_slave_leia_pics I walked away because I realized that leftism is a sickness. 

They want healthcare for all? I mean come on! 
They want “livable wages”? What?! 
They want to have less wage disparity? Bullshit! 
They want minorities to have equality? Fuck! 
They want common sense gun laws! No! 
They want our country to quit acting as a global puppet master and warmonger? What the fuck?! 
They want the poor to have access to education? No. Just no. 
They want to tax the rich at the same or higher rate than the poor? Goddamn it! 
They want all these crazy, insane, utopian, lies! 
Just lies! 

I want trump 2020. MAGA! MAGA! MAGA! 

MUELLER AINT GOING AWAY! MAGA!  Why I #walkaway
iClex I was a SJW feminist but I just cannot stand it anymore. White males are supposed to be so privileged but the tarrifs are fuck**g me over. Why cant the other countries see why Trump is imposing tarrifs? Why do they have to counter them? These fucking SJW EU muslim countries. 

I swear to jesus I will vote R in the next elections if these tariffs dont Stop. Someone has to show our "allies" with whom we defeated the nazis who the REAL nazis are - sjws, muslims, (((journalists))) and those god damn socialistic communists.

I have cancer and I rather die (hopefully after elections) than have free healthcare for everybody. Because everybody even means blacks, muslims, illegals and (((Others))). Why cant we just have free healthcare for REAL Americans?

The next years will be hard and I hope my two beautiful sons will make it without their father. Let's just pray that TRUMP will beat the other countries and these tariffs stop and my family can make money again and live the WHITE American Dream!

MAGA Finally stepping into the Red Light - MAGA
MrPete001 Like the title says. But also I think they think they’ll win in November with a blue wave, then (if they win the senate) they’ll ease up on immigration, and expect the new immigrants votes. 

Just a thought I think the Democrats at capital hill will milk migration as long as they can up till 2020
kriegson Not an exhaustive list. Keep in mind it's best not to feed the trolls but if you must, don't waste a lot of energy on it and leave something for lurkers. Don't expect an honest response out of anything you give them.  

People often forget what an *intellectual* argument is. It's give and take. Trolls turn it into a gotchya game for points where if you get tilted, they win.

----------  

* "You're all Russian bots!"  

If you made a venn diagram of the people act like foreign influence is responsible for the destruction of western civilization and compare them to the people who support abolishing ICE, Open borders or #refugeeswelcome you'd have a Circle.    

* Guilty by association  

The same people who would likely claim "You post on 4chan? You most be a /pol/ Nazi!" are the same people who think T_D, KIA and other such subs are filled with nazis...but post on reddit.  

You can find a watered down version of pretty much any and every accusation here is it's "Well...you're not a Russian troll/Nazi/Bigot/etc but did you know you're tangentially related to them because of X? You're practically the same!"   

* "You don't meet MY standards for #walkaway so you don't count!"  

Primarily "I see you post on T_D or have X opinions! You're lying!". Ignoring of course [a lot of people chose to #walkaway  back in 2016 ](https://www.270towin.com/live-2016-presidential-election-results/state-by-state/) and their opinions may have changed since. But given they can't accept the election results, let alone this sub and movement, they aren't going to accept that either.    

* Wild goose chase  

"Source?" is a simple request in a sub that isn't being brigaded. In a sub that is, you can see it often becomes a never-ending moving of goalposts where nothing you offer is good enough to meet their standards of proof.  
Often statements with truthful hyperbole or an element of practical colloquialism are dissected in the most literal sense possible to try and discredit them based on the hairs they find to split.   

* "I just want to know what you think" (Proceeds to argue everything)

See above as well. Another tricky one that you have to read the context of the situation and recognize when it's happening. In a sub that *isn't* being brigaded, yeah usually fine. In a sub *constantly* being brigaded, it's a way for trolls to try to fly under the radar by feigning ignorance and innocence while "Just asking for your opinion" but then arguing everything you say.   

It's especially obvious when one troll posts an "innocent question" and several others dogpile anyone who responds.   

---------  

People who are intentionally being dishonest aren't worth your time and effort! Don't feed the trolls! Report and move onto constructive endeavors.  The kinds of trolls you'll find in #walkaway
bfrager1278 Ever since the election the liberals have been acting like autistic toddlers who don't get what they want at the supermarket. You can't have intelligent discussion with one (especially on reddit) without being called a racist, bigot, homophobe etc. NEWSFLASH not everybody you disagree with is a racist. ALSO just because I support SOME things that trump does doesn't instantly make me a racist. AND TO ALL OF THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS OUT THERE. The man acts like a 12 year old edgelord that you come across on xbox live. The man is ANNOYING. I can't associate myself with the crybaby liberals who scream and shout, threaten trump supporters with violence, scream RACIST at everyone they disagree with and the breaking point for me the Peter Fonda tweets about baron trump. Hate Trump all u want and talk shit about him all you want but please leave the fucking kids out of it. I also find hardcore trump supporters very annoying. So fuck all of you people. In 2020 I'm gonna be sitting on the sidelines with a huge bag of popcorn.   RANT: FUCK THE LIBERALS AND TO HELL WITH TRUMP I"M AN INDEPENDENT NOW!!!
-KAS How the left uses identity politics to hate-label, pidgeon-hole and demonize arbitrary groups of people they make up, and put you in. These groups are always based on race, gender (not really sure what this means anymore) and sexual preference.     
    
Your skin color and where you put your genitals in your free time is completely irrelevant in the context of your ideas and opinions on how to make this country better. Ironically, their political strategy is inherently racist and sexist, and I'm not cool with that.    
    
You're not just Johnny Walker to them, you're a privileged "Straight white cisgendered" spokeman and your opinions are only held because you're trying to put the people of your same race and sexual preference at the top of the power hierarchy.  When I noticed that is when I thought "Nope. I'm done. I don't agree with this.". Since then I've walked away and have been outspoken to my peers about this ever since.        
    
By walking away I didn't walk to the other end of the political spectrum by any means. I am now an independent, an individual, a person with an array of different opinions and views that don't always lineup with one party or the other.    
    
And when I discovered this subreddit and saw the manifesto on youtube, I was overcome with joy because it seems people are finally getting smart on this terrible political tactic that our once beloved political party decided to indoctrinate.    
    
**LONG LIVE #WALKAWAY** I was a liberal up until about a year ago when I noticed
vincethered It's just like /r/The_Donald except the mods don't reflexively ban everyone who disagrees with the main premise... How long do you think it's going to last? As an actual Liberal I like this sub in a way.
Beelzebubbin About two years ago, just after the election, I left the Democratic Party. At first, I was unsure of where to nest. After being totally open in discussions I quickly realized that the conservative right holds more of my own values than I thought could ever be possible. Sensible conversation and friendliness from the right drew me in like a moth to a flame. My life has never been better. I have stopped doing so much drinking and being immaturely pissed off all the time. My life has purpose again and a better purpose at that. I value myself more so and I no longer see the world, or this country, as an evil enigma. I work harder at my job than I ever have and have excelled in my line of work so quickly I’m living very comfortable. It’s amazing what just your politics can do to bring your family together as well. I have completely changed my lifestyle since I no longer hang out with people who are negative about everything all the time. Walk away. It feels great! Walking away was the best decision of my life.
jrbanks3 I (definitely a Democrat) have decided to walk away from the party because I definitely have been a Democrat and now I definitely am not. I don’t like what those libtards, I mean Democrats are doing so I’m leaving the party. I want to reiterate that I am definitely not a republican trying to make a fake movement seem legit.  I’m finally doing it!
conspiracythierry Add your reasons for leaving the Democratic party in this growing thread  MEGATHREAD - 100 REASONS TO #WALKAWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS, Curated by r/WalkAway
-KAS Walk away from both the Democrat and Republican party. You don't have to fall into one of these parties. You're an individual with an array of views and opinions.      
    
You are NOT your political party. You are a person. A person with opinions and ideas. I hope we can come together, people of all races, sexual orientations, prior political affiliations and other differences, as people, together, to better the state of this country.    
    
I hope to find others here that share my view and if you don't I'd like to time to have a discussion with you.    
    
PEACE. #WalkAway from BOTH parties - Each one of us is an individual - Not to be placed in one box or the other
damnedforyoursins They only appeal to centrists and are weak to the increasingly xenophobic Republican Party. We need a party that will actually fight Trump and refuse corporate doners.

I’m not an idiot so I will still vote to get rid of republicans. I’m walking away from the Democrats
Clatsop Once upon a time, I was a liberal. 

Well, to be honest, less than a year ago, I was still a liberal. 

I became a liberal because I felt I’d found a tribe whose values aligned with my own. 

I staunchly reject racism of any kind, I reject the marginalization of any human being based off of their gender or sexual orientation. I reject tyrannical group think, I reject a system which allows an ambitious, misinformed, and dogmatic mob to suppress free speech, create false narratives, and apathetically steamroll over the truth. 

I reject the acceptance of junk science and superstition to advance ideological agendas.

I reject hate. 

These are the reasons why I became a liberal and these are the same reasons why I am now walking away.

For years now, I have watched as the left has devolved into intolerant, inflexible, illogical, hateful, misguided, ill-informed, un-American, hypocritical, menacing, callous, ignorant, narrow-minded, and at times, blatantly fascistic behavior and rhetoric.

Liberalism has been co-opted and absorbed by the very characteristics it claims to fight against. For years now, I've watched as people on the left have become anesthetized to their own prejudices and bigotry and the prejudices and bigotry of those around them who echo their values. I have watched these formerly-sensible people, who claim to reject racism, have come to embrace the principles of universally hating and blaming all of society's problems on all people who have white skin. I have witnessed the irony of advocacy for gender equality morph into blatant hatred and intolerance of men and masculinity. I have seen the once-earnest fight for equality for the LGBT community mutate into an illogical demonization of heteronormativity and the push to vilify and attack our conventional concepts of gender. 

These same self-proclaimed victims of intolerance [are] now turning on the gay community that they once attached themselves to advance their agenda, [are] now calling gay people 'privileged' and themselves 'victims' of injustice. I have watched as the left has allowed themselves to become hypnotized by false narratives and conclusions, perpetuated by social justice warriors who misrepresent and misconstrue facts and evidence and events to confirm their own biases that everyone who does not comply with their prejudicial conclusions and follow their orders is a racist, a bigot, a Nazi, a white supremacist, homophobic, Islamophobic, xenophobic, misogynist, and alt-right extremist. And I've watched as they've used these heartless and carelessly-assigned labels to intimidate, threaten, bully, silence, attack, un-employ, blacklist, and destroy anybody who dares to fight back. 

They'll come for me and then they'll come for you. 

And worst of all, the Democratic Party and the liberal media has embraced, affirmed, aided, and abetted this cult ideology. In an effort to gain voters and maintain power, the Democratic Party that I once loved has joined forces with the extremist left. The Democratic Party and the liberal media now believe their own ill-gotten conclusions and have ominously decided that they –and only they – know the remedy for society's ills. 

The Left has decided that the solution to problems with race relations in America is more racism. The Left believes that attacking, insulting, and dehumanizing one group of people elevates another. The Left now believes that there are no boundaries when telling lies, omitting the truth, or misrepresenting the facts when telling the news because their end justifies their means. The Left has now decided that its point of view is the only acceptable one and that suppressing, censoring, and banning open debate is virtuous and progressive. The Democratic Party has adopted a deleterious belief system, happily and without skepticism, separating people into groups based off of identity and then organizing them into camps of 'victims' and 'oppressors.' 

If you are a person of color, an LGBT person, a woman, or an American immigrant, the Democratic Party wants you to know that you are a victim and destined to stay that way. They will insist that you are a victim doomed to exist within a system that is rigged against you, that you are a victim of systemic oppression, that you are a victim of your circumstances, and that no amount of hard work or motivational action will ever allow you to overcome your victimhood or the privilege of those around you. 

This is perhaps the Democratic Party's greatest and most insidious lie. 

But if you are a minority in America today, the left-wing politicians and the liberal media don't ever want you to ever discover this lie. So they bombard us with stories designed to reinforce this narrative that you are in danger, that you cannot succeed. They manipulate your fears and concerns by telling you that you are disadvantaged, disempowered, and disposable to everyone – except to them. They will tell you that you need them. They will tell you that you are only safe under their supervision. They will promise to liberate you from all that chains you. 

And then, they will do absolutely nothing for you. 

Once upon a time I was a liberal. But liberalism has changed. And I will no longer be a part of an ideology or political party that represents everything that contradicts my values of unity, equal opportunity, personal empowerment, compassion, and love. 

So I am walking away. 

And I encourage all of you to do the same. 

Walk away.  FULL TRANSCRIPT OF BRANDON STRAKA’S VIDEO
Trumpets22 Spoiler alert: you don’t. You may think this is all fake, but I am a legitimate walk away, even still a registered Democrat. (albeit it’s only because I think it’s funny they assume they have my vote) for the liberals reading this, I want you to know you are one of the main reasons I left. My views did not radically change, I hold conservative, liberal, and libertarian views. To me, it makes no sense how someone can believe one side has EVERYTHING right. I just view my left leaning views to be more petty and unimportant. So, I’ll probably never vote liberal again. 

Reason one I left: liberals. I could no longer stand the painful hypocrisy. Calling everyone who disagrees with them a fascist in attempt to stop all discussion is too rich. Calling everyone who disagree with them racist sounds weak. I realized that most* liberals are not interested in a discussion, just attacking. And ironically enough, while constantly preaching “acceptance” we were also not supposed to accept people who had different political opinions. Even my own family will tell me they don’t want to talk politics when I open my mouth and then proceed to have one side political discussion. It’s not that they don’t want to talk politics, they don’t want to be challenged and disagreed with. Some liberals are fantastic debaters, most will just act smug and assume you’re a dipshit for not agreeing with them and will do nothing but throw buzz words at you. Both sides can be toxic, but the bleeding hypocrisy is painful.

Reason two: The zero integrity from the Democratic Party. I never liked hill-da-beast, but I was a r/sandersforpresident stooge. I believed in a lot of Bernie’s message, although I now realize logistically speaking it’s almost all a joke. When you have the anti-establishment mind set, Bernie to Trump is not a far leap. And as an adult I will say my mind did change and realize lower taxes and giving people opportunities is a better direction for this country than higher taxes and more government control. I was not a delusional Bernie supporter, I knew it was over long before California and the “HE CAN STILL WIN” got old very fast. Bernie himself said that Hillary is the EMBODIMENT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT and then went onto support her. Knowing good and well that the DNC worked very hard against him. This felt like a spineless betrayal and opened me to start looking at the other side. I was tired of weak people and the Democratic Party showed me that they don’t really give a shit what the American people want. GOP sure as shit didn’t want Trump, but he still destroyed the competition. The game of it all and how he did it was something I could respect.

Reason 3: The power and control the left holds over entertainment and information. I realized that I hated Trump and the republicans because of Facebook videos and late night comedy host and that I actually had not done much research and looking myself. I could spot right wing propaganda easily and for some reason left wing propaganda went over my head. Eventually realizing this, it became apparent how much control and power liberals have over things that make up our minds. Think about it, the MSM, tv shows, movies, most celebrities, late night comedy, social media, and major info distributors like google. ALL LIBERAL STRONGHOLDS. This amount of power scares me, and when the richest most powerful people all tell me to go left, I get VERY skeptical of their true motives and intentions. It’s far too much power and almost nobody is capable of using that kind of power for good. 

Maybe this doesn’t help, maybe you don’t believe me. I just wanted to show my side and state that this is a legitimate movement. I’m very excited to see the results later this year and again in 2020. Politics is a game, let’s not get so worked up and have a little fun with it. The mod team LOVES actually discussion and we hope that’s what you are here to do. #walkaway
 How does one so radically change their views!?!?

vincethered ... Just be sure what you're walking toward.

&gt;The Justice Department announced indictments against 12 Russian nationals as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, accusing them of engaging in a "sustained effort" to hack Democrats' emails and computer networks.

insidemyvoice Quick question, how many of you haven't moved right or left in your beliefs but the left has moved so far that you looked around and found yourself on the right. In other words you didn't move right but the left moved further left. A question
WadeTrillson I could write a literal novel on the reasons I'm no longer a democrat. I realized Obama was a placebo president for black voters. I realized HRC is a power hungry, corporate puppet who feels like she is OWED the white house. I realized that 'free shit' is not really free because somebody is paying the bill (that would be ALL of us). Also, 'free shit' tends to go down in value and effectiveness when ran by the government. I realized the equality fight is teetering on discrimination in some regards (especially with the new age feminist movement). I realized that having a difference of opinion about certain social topics was not tolerated. I realized that the position on guns and regulation is completely dishonest, misguided and bullheadedly stubborn. I realized that democrats are literally willing to set fire to democracy simply because their candidate didn't win. I realized that the left is willing to destroy anybody who attempts to have civil discourse with the right (kanye, steve harvey, kim k, omarosa, etc.). I realized that the left wants the government to be it's nanny and accept no responsibility or accountability for themselves but will piss and moan every time the gov't falls short on their 'duty'. But what really made me realized I was no longer a democrat was the fact that other people came to these realizations as well, voiced their concerns and the party doubled down in their ignorance and flaws in response. How is that 'progressive' or 'inclusive'?

I think HRC would make a terrible president. I condone having discussions with people you disagree with. ESPECIALLY if they are the ones running your country. I'm not in favor of 'free shit'. I'm in favor of 'more affordable' shit. Find a way to bring the prices down (ie. stop jerking off corporations and let the free market do it's thing), don't make everybody pay the high bill. I'm not in favor of open borders. I'm not in favor of prison reform because people in prison did something to be put there. &lt;~~~ all of that used to be considered a fairly democratic point of view about 10 years ago. Not anymore. As of 2016, I'm also against further gun control. Instead, I think the money funneled into anti-gun lobbying should be diverted to underfunded schools and job creation in urban areas to decrease ALL violent crime in high crime areas. But David Hogg is Christ reincarnated to the left so... *shrug*... I guess I won't be registering as a Dem again for a long time. I didn't exactly walk away. I kind of just shrunk in the corner and watched the room go mad.
queenofmemphis I've considered myself a leftist-turned-rightist since around 2014, and i'm really glad we finally have a community since i obviously can't talk about it IRL and most rightist forums are filled with people who were always rightists.

So, when did you wake up? How did your liberal friends treat you afterwards? I actually never came out as a rightist to my friends, they still think i'm a pretty liberal guy and frankly i'm kind of afraid with all the antifa stuff going on.   Just wanted to say that i'm happy to see this sub. We finally have a community.

CentsOfFate I am just curious how people in this sub are handling their workplace environment. Ever since James Damore got fired from Google for voicing his opinion, I've kept nearly everything under the table. I minimize encounters with other people and I keep my head down. I don't want to be the next sorry person to get kicked out the door just because somebody is looking for racism/sexism in anything people say and report it HR.

I wanted to ask you guys if you have highly politicized workplaces and how you handle them. Or if you guys have stories of your own where somebody got shafted due to SJW-esque policies. #WalkAway and Politicized Workplaces: How do you handle your jobs?
LegkoVernyy It's not your Constitutional right! And it's not fair to our democracy and our wonderful, loving citizens! 

And what has the Dems done for you anyway? Free health care, public schools, public education, Obama phones, marijuana legalization, open borders, is that really enough of a bribe for you to sell away your dignity and chain yourself to the Clinton Foundation Plantation? Do your research and find out what the elite globalist liberal socialist cabal really does to minority children!!!! I humbly ask that all the millions of illegals who voted for Hillary in 2016 to #walkaway from our citizens voting polls!
CodeGag I started off my **freshmen year** of high school as a **liberal** and I left as a **conservative**, I am now the only conservative member in a family (though no one in my family knows because I do not want to become the black sheep of the family) in a liberal state in a liberal school. I used to think all **Republicans where old white men that hated minorities** (people like me). That's what I had been told all my life, but that all changed when after the parkland shooting and the teacher spoke about how we should ban guns (AR-15 and other rifles) I told questioned her on it and she told me to do research on guns and so I went down the conservative rabbit hole. I watched Steven Crowder's Pro gun change my mind, Ben Shapiro debating on various topics and such. After a while I went on to debate my fellow classmates and this is when I **realized** just how **toxic** the left has become. I got threatened to get **beat up by one of classmates** for voicing my views, called a **white sympathizer** for being republican and even a **teacher threatening to send me to the deans** for stating I had no problems with guns. The climate in my high school is toxic and non welcoming to conservatives which would explain why other republicans in my school don't speak out, the crowd mentality and the victimization is why I left, and why I don't plan on coming back. Thank you #WalkAway I'm Hispanic(Mexican) and I #walkedaway
BFG9THOUSAND The guy had charisma I bought into his "take down the billionaire class" spiel.  I did not consider myself republican or democrat before 2016-  I was registered independent.  I could see how shit Obama was for our country- and Hillary was 10x worse.  When I saw all the corruption and rigging of the primaries, and then to see Sanders just roll over and endorse Hillary- that was it for me.

I always saw Republicans as just "angry old men" like my Dad.  And i honestly dont know why... I was afraid of confrontation and sucked into TYT back then.  But I really woke up when TYT endorsed Hillary- it was a big joke.  I never knew how brainwashed I was by leftist media... its scary looking back honestly. 

But, I did think Trump was hilarious the whole primary.  He was shitting on everyone and I secretly loved it.  But then he would show grace when people bowed out of the primaries.  Idk what exactly it was that got me to support Trump,  but the man is a god damn genius... he really is.  The past 2 years have been absolutely incredible and I thank God every day that Trump won.  My only regret is voting Jill Stein (LOL) which I will NOT be repeating!!!  

I have been on the Trump train now since his first month in office. God bless Donald Trump! I was an independent who supported Bernie
Royce_Fox I it for the fact that it has the goal in mind to getting the democrats and the liberals to turn away from what the party is becoming. 

I like it because it approaches to liberals in a friendly manner instead of "you are worthless loosers and we are gonna percecute you for not being right wingers like us" sort of narrative i find in right winging subreddits.

While i doubt it will outright destroy the democratic party due to the fact that the former democrats will hold on to their core beleifs, i do beleive that this will bring back civilty between conservative and liberal groups.

Now lets hope this doesnt turn into a conspiracy theroy cult. I applaud this subreddit
Royce_Fox I had a long thought about how we can get liberals to walk away from the democratic party. Now with these ideas i may end up rubbing some people thd wrong way. Guess what, i dont care. Now here is what i have planned, which are more of vague plans, but its open for interpretation.

1 advertise that your party is good because your party did good things, and nothing else. This usually means that you have to show what positive things your party did that appeals to the good intentions that liberals have overall (promote equality, protecting small businesses, ensuring the poverty struck people gets the opprotunity to get out of poverty). But at the same time, you need to focus less on showing how bad the other side is. You can show how bad dnc is but if you dont show how good you are, youre not going to get anyone to join or at least leave the democratic party. A famous quote, "blowing out another man's candle will not make yours shine brighter."

2 show compassion for democrats and liberals.  throwing insults to liberals and labling them as horrible people just because of their political affiliations and beleifs is like judging a black man for the color of his skin. It makes you look no better than liberals and will drive liberals back to the democratic party. After all, we arent out of the racist/bigot stereotypes yet and labling liberals as bad people will just reinforce the said stereotypes. In fact, labling people by party affiliation is what the extreme left does and look how it built a wall between the good liberals and the bad ones. There are good people on both republican and dmeocratic parties as well as bad ones. We need to search for the good people on the democrat party and have them join or at least leave the democratic party. After all, that is what #walkaway is meant to be, right?

3 promise for a compromise on your part. Its not easy, and it may go against what you beleive, but its the only way you can get liberals to join you. Alright? Its part of life. We have to compromise on some of our values or just let certian obama era laws remain to get liberals join.

4 kkk isnt democrat anymore. That info was outdated decades ago. Democrats severed ties with the kkk and i dont see any members openly supporting them in recent years. If anything, the democrats would openly support anyone who the public finds as the most racist. The kkk is independent at most.

Now i hope these help. How are we going get more people to leave the democratic party
Kindasucessfulbutlaz College student here who actually donated time and money to his campaign. My “aha” moment of when I realized I was supporting the wrong party was when all the corruption from the DNC came out and Bernie did nothing. How could a man who spoke so passionately about anti-corruption and standing up the establishment. He literally rolled over backwards Hilary and essentially stood back and help rig our democracy for a candidate in a 2 party system. He should’ve ran as an independent regardless if it would’ve took away from the Democratic base. People say it was courage but I believe it was a slap to all the people who bought into his message. 

I’ve began to look at actions instead of words and I’m way better off at it. I think this is the reason why a lot of people hate Trump and a lot of people love him as he might not be the best speech giver/talker but is a man of his word and follows up on promises. It took me two years of independent research, listening to philosophical debates, and viewing both sides handle the same situation via media to formulated my own opinions. I’ve changed my views on guns, socialism, victim culture, Isreal and much more etc. I’m still formulating my own opinion on a variety of topics too. I believe like me we all share the inept quality of wanting to learn more and discovering the error of our way. This is mental growth and I’m proud to #Walkaway I volunteered and donated to Bernie’s campaign.
dangeron My first time voting was in 2012 for Obama, but I remember being appalled at the right's reaction to him winning in '08. It just seemed so blatantly racist and in poor-taste for them to pull the birther thing. Not to mention the other sorts of protests.

I voted for him in 2012 because I thought he was still trying to bridge the gap between the parties. It became obvious, especially towards the end of his second term, that wasn't a priority. 

I voted for Bernie in the primaries but wasn't really surprised to see the DNC nominate Hillary. Like everybody knew it was her last shot at the White House. 

Then liberals started protesting against Trump. It seemed like there was a new one every couple days. A few of them turned into riots. People started attacking police officers. I could not fucking believe it. 

It's only gotten worse since then. I didn't vote in the general election, and I don't think can't bring myself to support a party that seems to have given up on common sense/decency. Some of the things that even celebrities are doing now are just morally indefensible or immature. It honestly sucks to see one of my favorite actors on-stage yelling "Fuck Trump" like a 9-year-old. That's not how you heal the country.

For everyone saying that Russians are sowing divide in the US, there are examples like that in which we could take the opportunity to reach out instead of turning our backs. We need to fix this shit, and if you disagree with that, then your priorities are in the wrong place. My family has been voting democrat ever since I can remember. I'm walking away.
Twv412 As an African American man, I was raised to be a Democrat in St. Petersburg, R̶u̶s̶s̶i̶a̶ Florida by the deep state, and I stayed that way for almost two decades. I spent my free time giving abortions to undocumented immigrants and destroying good white American's property, all so that I could help declare a socialist republic in America that would shoot all straight white men on sight.

I walked after Chuck Shumer coughed in a way I didn't like, and I decided that I wasn't a moderate Democrat anymore, and that I should become a far right reactionary, who worships Donald Trump, like all reasonable people do.

Ignore those polls! A read wave is coming, my very legitimate story is proof of that!

GiantRephaim As someone who left the left a decade ago after finding out their past, which controls their future, research is the key to understanding.

I plan to post many things from my 17 years of research into many things, including the left, and the right. The right has it's demons as well, but the left are the ones who claim they are saviors, but I will explain it's a sham, and a scam.

Just to start things off, is Yuri Bezmenov, who is the KGB defector who exposed the plan they were using to infiltrate the American left who they referred to as useful idiots for the purpose of ideological subversion to bring the US down from within using generational psychological warfare. The first phase was demoralization:

KGB defector Yuri Bezmenov's warning to America

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA)

Then there is Larry Grathwol. He had infiltrated the weather underground through the FBI, which was a communist group who had planned to overthrown the US government, and kill millions of Americans, who couldn't be reeducated through camps. The weather underground was aligned by people like Saul Alinsky, and Bill Ayers who was followed by Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton, a former president, and one who plans to run in 2020.

These were people in the weather underground who were college educated, and planned to overthrow the US to implement a new Marxist utopia in their minds. He asked them how they were going to house and feed the people, or keep the economy going, and they didn't have any answers. Their thought was after killing Americans, Russia and China would come in to help control the US. This is insane, and these are the people the left look up to believe it or not. This is why they are so dangerous:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2pMkkXIDrM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2pMkkXIDrM)

When you look into Bill Ayers, and his connections to Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama this will start to make sense, as to what happened over the last decade. Saul Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer the original change agent to transform and rebel, which is what the left hand path of Satanism is all about along with the Jacobins of the french revolution of terror. Then you find out Barack Obama's mentor from his book dreams of my real father is a communist named Frank Marshal Davis who looked after him in Hawaii, before his mother took him to live in Indonesia where she remarried Lolo Soetero, which is why Barack Obama's alias is Barry Soetero, which is the name he used back then, and in college.

There is so much corruption of Clinton who plans to run again in 2020 and Barack Obama, the manchurian candidate, who was so controlled it's embarrassing. Then you look into who Obama surrounded himself with, it's many communists, including John Brennan, who even voted for the communist running for president decades ago. 

To be continued... Reasons to leave the left. Links exposing them for who they really are at the higher levels who control the lower levels.
MedTex1 All American all day, it's ok to walkaway. So proud.... I love you guys, and so does Trump
BadNerfAgent This may be out of the scope of this movement since I've long walked away and today I resemble just another the_donald shitposter.

However, back since about 2001 I was very much a democrat. A big fan of Michael Moore films and I learned about how GW Bush stole the election from Gore, I listened to a lot of protest music and punk (and still do), loved Bill Hicks etc. Basically, a very anti-establishment leftist at a time where the real fascism was coming from the Christian right.

I got involved in the anti-war movement. This is at a time when I just switched from dial-up modem to broadband and it allowed watching documentaries over the internet feasible. This is where I really started to become informed. I was warned over and over again from people I respected that the democrats were pro-war but using the anti-war movement to win the house in 2006. My trust in both parties at this point started to wane but I used the '06 midterms as a way to guage who the democrats really were. At this point, I was falling down the rabit hole and didn't know who to trust but at least the democrats were promising to end congressional funding for the war so I thought if we let them win the house and they stop the funding, that's a win and if they don't, then at least I know to distrust the leftwing media as much as the right.

Sure enough, they won the house and not only did they not stop the war, but they literally destroyed the anti-war movement. Everyone around me disappeared and all that was left were the few crazies that warned this was going to happen. I was extremely surprised but it made complete sense. I've never trusted the mainstream media since. I #walk(ed)away in 2006, can I post my story?
SocialInjustice4All Saturday night, the executive committee of the Democratic party in California elected far left liberal Kevin de Leon for their bid for a US Senate seat, ignoring the overwhelming majority of their party that voted for moderate Democrat Diane Feinstein. 

Democratic voters in the state cast 2.9 million votes for Feinstein, and only 804,000 for de Leon, but their party doesn't care. Even when voters turn out in millions to support moderation over extremism, the party sticks to it's isolationist ways. 

Democracy is dead in the Democratic party. #WalkAway Democratic Party in California rejects its member's primary vote in favor of far-left candidate.
burrito-supreme- This happened about a year ago. A buddy of mine with a Trump 2016 sticker on his old M3 and got his tires slashed on his own street. 

When he called the cops to report it they literally asked him why he had that sticker on his car, and said that maybe that wasn’t such a good idea... then proceeded to be super rude to him and made light of the incident because in their mind he incited it. He was calm and polite and didn’t even let it bother him. When I asked him why he just shrugged it off and said he always knew that could happen, but he wasn’t going to let that stop him from his freedom of speech. 

Another friend of mine has a Trump sticker on his Jeep and has to be careful what parts of our liberal, ultra tolerant city he drives through. 

The funny thing is either one of these guys would be the first person to pull over and help you out if they saw you stranded on a highway. The three of us have bought and fixed up cars for less fortunate friends and helped people move, paint houses, whatever. They’re hard working, immature, fun loving, patriotic guys with hearts of gold. 

In a lot of ways I’m pretty liberal. I think Trump is an idiot and I voted third party last election because as bad as Trump is I could have never voted for Hillary. But I judge people by what they do, not what they say. And people on the left say all he prettiest things but the further left you go the more toxic people get. Meanwhile the a lot of the nicest, most tolerant people I’ve ever met are Republicans. We can talk and disagree and even argue but only rarely is anyone called names and at the end of the day we’re all friends.

Compare that to the culture of offense, the victimhood olympics, and the perpetual outrage/hatred factory the American left has become. The “correct” way to feel and think about things is getting narrower and narrower and guess what? I’m done. I’d urge everyone who is walking away to please consider voting Libertarian or any viable third party this election! Because Democracy needs more than two choices and both parties are actively working against giving you a third choice.  Buddy got his tires slashed by tolerant liberals, and cops laughed at him
General_Tso88 I've been a Democrat for most of my life, it was my own choice and everything since my parents arent political at all. I'm not going to go into detail on my reasons since thats not what I'm asking. What I want to know is are you guys just flipping sides to support Republicans or are you going 3rd/Indie? I can't honestly say I like the conservative side much at this point either, it just seems to be the saner side at this point (lol)

Tldr: Are you guys leaving one side for the other, or are you starting to lean more towards a 3rd party? What is everyone walking away to?
palinshomeboy92 My journey to #walkaway began November 2016 in the aftermath of the election. My world in disarray, family and friends panicking after Trump was announced president. I kept my wits about me. Expected the unexpected. Started seeking out contacts who supported the Republican party and President Trump. Educated myself. Learned that the hate and fearmongering I had been taught to associate with the Right was truly the left projecting its own insecurities. My life had been a lie.

I let it build for months. Thoughts swirling in my mind and a darkness on the horizon. Certain as day, the new facts I was learning about the world were confirmed. One after another. First through conventional channels. Twitter, comments on mainstream news. Eventually I found real Truth organizations and learned to see through the deception, read between and behind the enemy lines.

The great realization: The Republicans were fighting this war for peace! Yes, this is a war. A war for the minds - the loyalty - of the people. The democrats were the ones resisting the embrace of change, the power of truth denied them by their own prejudices. My journey to #walkaway has begun, but it is ongoing to this day.

I am informing my friends and family of this place. I hope to enlighten them the way I was enlightened. I am grateful I live in autonomy and can reveal my truths without fear of backlash. For those who cannot, I wish great strength. Someday, we will all walk away. Raised as a democrat, but finally saw the light after the election.
pants_llama Former Berner here. I started thinking about walking away when I realized all the MSM did was lie about Bernie - so why should I listen to them about Trump? At first my reaction was to support Trump out of a hatred I had(have) for Hillary that was and is stronger than anything feeling I've ever had. Alas over time my belief in Trump has declined some, but I know I can **never** return to the party of the blatantly corrupt.

I don't agree with DJT on everything, but nor did I with Bernie. But it's the establishment that's rotten and it couldn't be more obvious. The democratic party as it exists today stands for this establishment and the entrenched ideas it supports. It boggles my mind how some words, recent or older, are more important than lies, countless crimes, wars, pay to play, election and voting fraud... Wall Street, public and private positions, etc.

In a sense, those still voting democrat are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. Even if an iota of what they said about Trump (or *any* opposition really) was true (and it's not) it still wouldn't be on the same fucking planet as what the Democrats have have turned into over the last few decades.

This journey of self discovery has been so educational for me. I now understand why one would choose to #walkaway, and that is what I choose to do. I never was an establishment kind of guy. The walkaway movement has helped me learn more about myself than I ever imagined.
stablegeniusboy You’re making this sub so great, we no longer need to look at the weather channel to learn what temperature it is in Moscow. Plus, we are gaining a better sense of how much Putin pays us trolls in rubles.  Thank you libtards
-KAS It's not about walking away to the other side. It's about being an individual and walking away from both [D] and [R] and uniting as individuals. To finally put a stop the bully tactics, violence, bias, censorship and harassment. Each of us is a person. A person with different ideas and opinions on policy. By making politics less about identity, we can focus on policy.    
    
This is a movement for free thinkers, not someone who wants to go to the other side of the coin. We have places for those that subscribe to political identities and identify as one or the other.  Don't let Republicans hijack this movement
-KAS Mods are almost entirely Republican and there's hijakers in this sub to confuse people about what this movement is actually about. It's not about walking to Republicans, but shedding your skin as a Democrat as a free thinking individual.    
    
It's clear to me this sub will become a T_D rebranding and is here to throw people off of the actual message of this movement.    
    
For now, we will meet in /r/NeutralPolitics/ It's clear this sub is disingenuous to the movement and is being used as a Republican recruiting tool - See you all in /r/NeutralPolitics/

Just because they say it isn't Russian interference (and say it loudly and often) doesn't mean it isn't. They're trying to gas-light us into thinking that it's not.

Clatsop I walked away from the Democratic Party 38 years ago due to my life experiences as a young man growing up during the Jimmy Carter presidency in 1977-1981.

After struggling to get by during the Carter years with its high levels of unemployment, high inflation, and high interest rates... I’d had enough of Carter and the Democrats, and was ready for a change.

I was ready to give a Republican named Ronald Reagan a chance. 

So I walked away.

I voted for Ronald Reagan in November of 1980, and *never* looked back.

conspiracythierry Vanessa Berben AMA, this Wednesday 7/18/2018 at 8pm ET    

&gt;I’ve been so inspired by the #WalkAway campaign that I'm getting over my fear and adding my voice. It’s such a shame what’s happening to our country. I’ve seen this quote in several places recently and it resonates with me enough to try and paraphrase it here: if your love for your country hinges on who is president, then you don’t love your country. I am so proud to be an American and have the right to sit here today and express these thoughts. I’ve tried to voice my concerns but it feels like such an all or nothing argument coming from the left. To vocalize any kind of dissenting opinion that doesn't fall in lock/step with “the war for social justice” gets us labeled a nazi, bigot, or some other kind of racist— sometimes by our own families. So here's my contribution to this movement. From one lifelong Democrat, here to say No More. I’m nowhere near Conservative, nowhere near Republican, but I’m still breaking up with my party. No more rabid cognitive dissonance, no more exaltation of victimhood-- I’ve chosen to #WalkAway. - Vanessa Berben

cryocel 1. Downvoting stickied posts doesn't do anything.

2. Downvoting stickied comments doesn't do anything.

3. Downvoting every post to zero makes them all equal and therefore doesn't hide or bury any of them.

4. Downvoting is not an argument and doesn't disprove what is being downvoted, it just shows petty anger and intellectual midgetry. Some important things for the brigaders and downvoters to remember.
PitoStinko So I noticed our sub and the names of some of the mods being dragged around a few radical left subs today.  These subs and its members are some of the most militant democrats you have ever seen.  I will not mention the names of these subs, but I will give you a conversation between two on a post that mentioned my name.

"You and be both know that Hillary is a immortal lizard person and the avatar of death. Age can't stop her."

"I mean, she may look old but those kid glands are gonna keep her runnin' another 100 years!"

I didn't edit or make up anything, they actually said that.

Anyways, this post isn't about that.  This post is about FLAIRS!  I noticed a bunch of the leftists in those brigade posts wanted to come and get their own flair but were concerned about getting banned.  I'll tell you what, I am not going to ban you and will give you a personal flair, but just follow the subreddit rules.

That means no Russia trolling, no posting pictures of Nazi images, no concern trolling, and no attacking members who have walked away.  It is that simple.  We welcome everyone here, and playful banter is fine, but you brigaders are crossing the line and you know it.

So come and get your flair, bring your friends, let's have some fun!

 Get'cha flairs! Come Geeeetcher flairs!
TheGlassStone Hello friends, I thought might delve into my story of walking away, which began in 2016. I have always been disenfranchised with our two party system, and have always considered myself an independent, and I’ve dreamed of voting for a candidate to shake up the status quo who would win. And Bernie Sanders was my guy.

I didn’t agree with a majority of things he represented, but you might’ve heard the media talking about voters who just wanted to smash the window of modern day politics with their vote, and one of those voters was me.

I didn’t care for any of the Republican candidates, though I did keep an eye on Trump. He fascinated me, and to be honest, had the election been between Bernie and Donald, I would’ve had a difficult time deciding who to vote for.

But then, during the primaries, the coin tossing to decide districts between Hillary and Bernie, Hilary won every single coin toss (which is almost statistically impossible) and my rage against the political machine of our country was kindled.

One by one, I watched Democrats throw Bernie under the bus, and it made me sick. On the other side, I saw the same thing with Trump. The laughs, the guffaws, the taunting. And I really felt that these two men were the right choice because they scared the establishment of both parties so much.

As soon as the conventions were over, I was depressed. There was no way in my mind that Trump could take out such an established candidate like Clinton and her billion dollar war machine. I threw up my hands and resorted to staying home.

But then I saw a headline in the news about this subreddit called The_Donald. And I heard about the overlooked voters and I saw poll numbers that weren’t reflected in the mainstream news I was watching. So I got on to check it out, and the love and outpouring support from everyone there swept me up. I was invited to go along to a DT rally in my town, and I relented. And there my mind was changed.

I saw this man in person, without a media lense and without talking heads spouting off their opinions, and I saw the high energy and passion these people had for the man who promised, like Bernie, to smash the status quo. And I was sold.

And on November 8th, in Central FL, I cast my vote for Donald J. Trump, and my vote, along with millions of other disenfranchised Americans, we put that man in the White House. Not the Russians, not a Reddit bot, not a foreign algorithm, but me, my own American flesh and blood who has been in this country since the early 1700’s. I did this, and I will do it again. My walk away story

Doc_Skeef And I can't tell you what a relief it feels like! To be able to just feel patriotic again is so great. 

I was a Hillary supporter because I hoped she'd help me get more access to  healthcare for my family. My son was born with unforeseen health problems that basically bankrupted our family. My ex now has sole custody after lying in family court. 

Long story short I just can't stand the hypocrisy of the left anymore; from Benghazi to the suspicious shootings in Florida and Las Vegas I started to peel back the layers.  The outcry to abolish ice was the last straw. Open borders? Really. We tried that already it was called narnia and it was fictional.

My point is there are many of us simple hard working Americans who are fed up with wasting time coddling different minorities. Watching POTUS Trump own these libs has made me want to #WalkAway

 I'm just disgusted by the treatment of Trump by the MSM, decided to walk away last week (before I even knew it was a thing)
burrito-supreme- I’ve been doing this constantly during the last couple years and just recently realized how ridiculous it is. And it obviously comes from a place of fear - of being shamed, ostracized, or ignored... 

“Hey, I hate Donald Trump as much as anyone *but*...” 

“I mean the Republican Party isn’t any better *but*...”

“I 100% support feminism and think women still face a lot of problems *but*....” 

“I know America has done lots of evil things and still has its problems *but*...”

“I really liked Obama as a person *but*...” 

Why is it that the only way I can remain friends with anyone on the left is to virtually neuter any remotely “conservative” opinions I may have right out of the gate? 

I can agree with certain policy choices of the Trump administration and shouldn’t have to prove to you that I hate him like you do in order to have a conversation about it. 

I can criticize the Democratic Party for specific things when they happen without bringing up Republicans,

I don’t have to be a feminist or use feminist theory to bring attention to issues that disproportionately affect men.

I don’t have to hate America, or bring up past transgressions I had nothing to do with to tell you how thankful I am to live here.

I can disagree with certain Obama policies without apologizing and reassuring people how much I actually liked him. 

I’m done working overtime to defend my reputation for being a decent person. The fact is that I don’t have a single party I like or agree with more than a 50%. I don’t like mainstream feminism or practically any “men’s rights” groups. I don’t think capitalism is a perfect system, nor do I think socialism is. I respect the scientific consensus that climate change is real, but so also know that pipelines are the safest way to transport oil... and every world economy needs oil at least for another 20 years or civilization would grind to a halt. 

I’m a moderate. Pretty close to the center on a lot of issues. But as the left moves further and further into nonsense land I guess that makes me look and sound more and more “right wing” and If I’m evil because of that, so be it. 

 

 I’m tired of prefacing everything I say in order to be heard.
Havok3c I’m walking away from the Republican Party. I just can’t be a willing member of it after our president chose Russia over the US  My walk away
cy_rus ☝️:) When liberals spam dislikes without reading the material while at the same time claim conservatives ignorant
PitoStinko We must go to war with Russia!  These Russian trolls influenced our election even those Rosenstein said they didnt influence any votes.  Either way, they cheated Hillary!  War! 

War is peace!

The more freedom people have to speak their mind, the more those thought crimes lead to violence.  Hate speech is violence.  Owning guns is violence.  Over regulation on business is good.  You can never have too much regulation.  Why should that rich man have the freedom to buy a Yacht with his own money, when I am on welfare?

Freedom is slavery!

I like how CNN told us that we are not allowed to look at Wikileaks, but they assured us that they will tell us what the leaks said.  As long as this article implies that Orange Man bad in the title, I upvote.  If someone who is pro Trump comments, I do not argue or debate with substance or facts, i chase them away with ad homs and insults...  Hey I am getting upvoted so I must be correct.  Why bother to learn anything when we all think the same?

Ignorance is strength!

The left really has become a spitting image of Orwell's writings. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.
Magnus_Konrad In one of the many #walkaway stories shared on this sub, I came across comments from a user that was not only skeptical of the legitimacy of the sub but also critical of its users. Our exchange landed directly on the subject of the DNC leaks and Russia's involvement...unfortunately the user was later banned before our dialogue could reach a natural conclusion. Surprisingly,the user, for whatever reason, sent me a private message, saying that they'd "Love to continue the conversation" so I took them up on it. Below is the transcript. Enjoy!

**Critic**

But I'm banned, enjoy your totally not T_D echo chamber.

**Me**

I'm sorry to hear you were banned. However, I'd be happy to continue our exchange. I'm genuinely interested in how you feel about factual evidence versus the source and whether or not you'd dismiss truth simply due to where it came from. It bothers me to see how much effort seems to have gone in to avoiding the material presented in the leaks. Does it bother you?

For the record I don't think anyone "deserves" to be hacked, but I absolutely believe that in today's digital age it is incumbent on us all to understand the platform is never wholly secure from intrusion. Especially if you happen to be a well-known civil servant in a high-ranking government position with access to state secrets you happen to keep on an undisclosed private server which exists outside of the government's knowledge and by extension it's ability to help safeguard it. I think that if John Podesta took data integrity seriously his password wouldn't have been acquired so easily by foreign adversaries. I think that the American people deserve to know about what's going on behind the curtain more than anything.

**Critic**

Well how do you feel about the indictments and evidence of corruption coming from the special council? Because if we're talking about dismissing evidence because of a source then we should establish weather or not any evidence coming out in 2018 holds any water because of its source.

**Me**

They're absolutely valid. Evidence of crime deserves, at the very least, sincere investigative efforts, and I'm glad it is happening. America has clearly taken cybersecurity for granted and it's obvious that needs to change.

Having said that, I absolutely believe sincere effort has been made to avoid the material presented in the leaks at all cost, and I doubt that it will ever be thoroughly investigated, even after we've figured out the who's and the how's. How do you feel about this side of the story? Do you feel that ignoring the material presented is the right thing to do since it happened came from an adversary?

**Critic**

I'm not trying to lead you by the nose when I ask this, but what crimes are you referring to that the Russian's have uncovered?

**Me**

Well offhand I'd say conspiracy to undermine the political process and potential financial crimes. You could probably tack on a violation of the espionage act due to it now having been proven that the server was penetrated by a foreign entity; something we would have never known were it not for the hacking.

It's hard to say exactly what violations of the law or their extent that could have been uncovered with a sincere investigation. Unfortunately there never was one, in part due to the Clinton campaign refused to provide their server for the FBI to examine, and, in my personal opinion, a lack of want by high-ranking FBI officials to expose something that could have shook the very foundation of our country.

**Critic**

I'm gonna be honest with you. I wrote out a 9750 character manifesto explaining things from nuclear war, to trump, to putin, to clinton, to the reasons why I posted in walkaway, to T_D to the New Right and their recruiting platforms and brainwashing techniques, and then I realized.

I don't know you, and I don't trust that this is a conversation intended to be in good faith. If you want to find the answers to your question just know two things.

All Humans are fallible.We can all be killed in 20 mins or less from human error.Look at peer reviewed political science articles for unbiased analysis of world events.

Sorry, three things.

**Me**

I'm sorry you feel that way, and I will confess that I'm disappointed you are ending the conversation before having addressed my own queries, whereas I responded to each yours. All I have to say in my own defense is that had I not wished to continue our dialogue in good faith then I'd have just ignored your initial message after you'd been banned.

I hope you're able to find peace in these troubled times.

**Critic**

It's just that the answer to your questions are infinitely more complex than can be explained in a reddit post, and to be honest its not worth the effort when 90% of the people who ask that question don't want an actual answer.

Tdlr; I answer all of their questions and they continually avoid mine, and when finally cornered, they flee. Typical shill. 

 When they can no longer deflect, they shut down. Sad.
Nrdrsr Full disclosure: I post very regularly on T_D and I think it's one of the most fun places on the internet. Everything I say is incredibly biased but my goal is to offer readers some perspective. I welcome disagreement. I will also solve any captcha you send me to prove that I am not a bot.

The rhetoric of many in the media and on capitol hill has been highly hostile towards Russia over the past 2 years.

The intelligence community (whom I, as a rule, always treat with a healthy dose of reasoned skepticism), has declared that Russia was ONE OF the hostile actors with access to the emails of the DNC and John Podesta. They have not proved that they were the source for Wikileaks and other leakers (there could have been many with access to the mails). However, given the overall activity by Russian state and non-state actors, I concede that it may be reasonable to suspect that they were involved.

Most of the emails leaked from the DNC and John Podesta were extremely tame and almost nothing newsworthy emerged from them. However, a small but significant percentage of emails contained information that uncovered aspects of candidate Clinton, her team and her party which turned some people against her as a candidate. Had ALL of the emails been as tame as the vast majority of the leaked emails, there would have been ZERO capacity for these emails to influence anyone about anything. The real substance at the very heart of this issue - is that there were things that were said privately that were shown to the public, who judged the candidate for it. The very same thing happened to President Trump, when he was recorded unbeknownst, and made crass remarks about the many gold-diggers he had encountered, when taping a television segment.

During one of the debates, Hillary Clinton stunned even the moderators when she indicated her preference to establish a no-fly zone in Syria. This is a statement of EXTREME importance when viewed in the context of international relations. The moderators asked her whether she intended to shoot down a Russian plane, to which she said she did not believe it would come to that.

In Libya, which former President Obama called one of the biggest mistakes of his Presidency, the no-fly zone was established with a promise that it would not be used as a cover for regime change - this is the only way the Russians agreed to this. When Gaddafi's regime was changed by NATO intervention, and footage emerged of him being sodomized with a bayonet, and Hillary's "we came, we saw, he died ahahaha" video was released, it became clear how utterly duplicitous the US State department had been in its promises to Russia. 

I don't believe in the idea of US imperialism. I don't believe in the idea of policing the world and putting up puppet regimes. This kind of foreign policy has caused MUCH of the suffering we see around the world today, and immense mistakes have been made by the USA in the past because of this.

When candidate Clinton professed her intention to set-up a no-fly zone in Syria, this was a very clear signal of what the intention was in Syria. She also spoke of arming the Kurds. Regime change was on the cards for Syria, and anyone who thinks that this kind of intervention would have solved Syria's problems is welcome to disagree, but the mountains of evidence for this kind of foreign policy leaves very little to cite as examples of why this kind of move is a bad idea. This is standard neocon foreign policy 101.

After 9/11 the USA sent troops to Iraq after fabricated evidence from the intelligence community. Saddam's regime was changed, and Iraq turned into a nightmare. Thousands of US soldiers died, and thousands of Iraqi civilians as well. Iraq is, to this date, still unstable and a war zone. This is the same fate that would have befallen Syria - which is allied with the Russian government.

Russia (rightfully) does not want the expansion of US military and economic power through this method of regime change. As hilarious as it sounds - this is actually a superior MORAL position. Bombing terrorists, destroying their infrastructure, and killing the civilians who very happily protect them, live in their compounds and offer them shielding, is also morally dubious, but it pales in comparison to the alternative - one of regime change, destabilization, resource extraction, rebuilding contracts to war profiteers like Halliburton, and a constant military presence either through troops or private military contractors.

As much of an asshole as Assad is. As much of an asshole as Putin is. Using military power to take them on is foolishness, and regular folks like us will suffer because of it. Playing chicken with the Russians or creating a destabilizing environment for the Assad regime is only going to provoke Russia further and further.

Unlike Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin does not have his hands tied because of dependence. Russia has strong ties to Iran, Israel and its relationship with India is probably the strongest between any two nations. 

President Trump's strategy in Syria has been merciless, some might even say cruel. ISIS has been bombed to near-oblivion. Assad is a brutal and evil dictator. If he is to be removed, this will mean war, or worse, arming radicals who will inevitably take up arms against the USA, as was the case with the CIA &amp; Afghanistan. 

The most sensible approach to keeping Assad in check with minimal bloodshed, is to improve US-Russia relations. Russia wields incredible influence over the Assad regime, and if folks are genuinely interested in ensuring that Assad behaves himself (as opposed to empty facebook virtue signalling), then this is the path of least bloodshed.

It is 2018. The USSR is gone. European countries get along - they even formed their own Union. Many of the young people of Europe (who make up their respective armed forces), would probably not even comprehend the thought of making war against fellow Europeans. Japan doesn't even have military strength anymore. Rather than clinging to outdated ideas of the past which actually don't even make sense anymore, if one is to look at a map of the world for trouble in this world where there are the absolute worst cases of wanton rape, destruction, child abuse, trafficking, slavery - it is at the hands of religious extremists in parts of Africa and the Middle East, and the rogue nation of Pakistan, which is ruled by its intelligence agency, the ISI.

How does the international community plan to make these places safe? By importing the most peaceful people from there? Surely that cannot be a long-term solution. All of these countries have good people who want to live in relative peace like you and me, and by sheer accident of birth, they ended up in hell. Our first-world problems are a walk in the park compared to the lives we live. The biggest threat to our collective stability comes in the form of religious extremism. All religions have lived through periods of barbarism and regressive ideas. In the 1500s, there were some parts of organized Christianity was immensely vicious, where Prince Bishops controlled armies in places like Germany, and slaughtered thousands. In 2018, there are some parts of organized and extremist factions of Islam who are equally, or perhaps more vicious. This is our enemy in 2018 - and the evidence is clear by the common thread running through most of the places you won't ever vacation in. There are plenty of wonderful places with massive Muslim populations that are great to visit, so my precise point here is that the enemy is Islamic extremism.

Russia, by comparison, despite all their power, is not even close to a priority. Visit Crimea sometime - talk to the people there. If you don't want to, look for any media coverage at all, of how the people of Crimea feel about being annexed. Threats to freedom, liberty and decent human beings are not met with the same welcoming attitude that the vast majority of Crimean residents display towards Russia. Compare Crimea to Libya, where the practice of open market slavery has returned after over 100 years, and you will know the difference that I am referring to.

So - if you believed that Russia "ATTACKED AMERICAN DEMOCRACY OH MY GOD" with their interference, it is importance to understand the context. President Trump beat 16 other Republicans before he squared off against Hillary Clinton. This is the former Secretary of State who further destroyed the USA-Russia relationship at a great cost to every human being on this planet. We have all heard the drums of war before - most recently in Libya, and in Iraq before that. 

You can bet money (based on her own words) that had things happened differently, Hillary Clinton would have won the election, imposed a no-fly zone, armed the Kurds with big badass military gear made in the USA (AMERICA FUCK YEAH), and Syria would be Libya 2.0. Instead, ISIS is on the run and we are facing an unprecedented overture between a USA and Russian leader, on a path to better relations. Ask yourself - if you had the ability to prevent that outcome, would you do it?  If you were a regular person like you and me sitting somewhere in the world, and you saw all this coming - death and destruction, and an entire country destroyed (like Iraq and Libya), wouldn't you want to intervene? There's a reason why American elections are watched by the whole world, because the outcome affects the whole world. When two giants fight, all the normal sized people have to run for cover. 

Whatever you may think of President Trump - I am confident that reasonable people would appreciate the importance of avoiding the outcome that Hillary Clinton put forth during her debate performance, and outlined in her intended foreign policy, which was reflected in her tenure as Secretary of State. 

We are blessed and fortunate to be alive today and not in the 1940s when folks lived during a world war. We are fortunate to not be the losers in a Cold War, where bread lines and economic ruin were the status quo. Many of us are fortunate to never have known the feeling of knowing that a loved one went off to fight in some senseless, godforsaken war and will never come home again. We are fortunate but this can all come crashing down if we are not careful. Do not give in to neocon politics. Recognize the immense power of persuasion that the war profiteers have - because we have lived through it repeatedly, in the various wars that the USA has undertaken as a result of its interventionist foreign policy.

Someday I hope to visit Nicaragua, El Salvador, Libya, Syria and South Sudan but I am quite sure I will never live to see that day. The world is a beautiful place, and many of these places were once peaceful. Let's make it great again. Sure things will not be perfect along the way. We'll have to tolerate questionable alliances. We'll have to turn people away when countries can't afford it, because you put on your own oxygen mask before you help others - it just makes more sense to ensure you don't do something that ends up being detrimental to everyone in the long run. We'll have to make imperfect choices, but they won't be no-fly zones, they won't be regime changes, and they won't be war. War is fucking terrible. Walk away from war with Russia. Walk away from war. [Long] Walk Away from War with Russia
Sara_Solo I don't really like browsing r/all/top anymore because you can tell that it's become carefully curated to present only narrative-approved things as the site moves towards an [adcentric model](https://redditblog.com/2018/06/12/native-video-ads-are-here/). This becomes especially apparent when you compare it to what r/all looked like [5-10 years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20090415044219/http://www.reddit.com:80/) where it really felt like it was normal 16-34 folks talking in an environment where opposing perspectives could rear their heads.

One of the last places where this exists on reddit today is r/all/controversial because by virtue of algorithm it only presents posts which score close to 50% upvoted and 50% downvoted. I always liked sorting by controversial in the early days of reddit because it showed you topics that broke the hivemind and groupthink that had always existed on the site and inevitably exists anywhere that functions like reddit. But lately, r/all/controversial is not a controversial place at all because, you see, most of the posts appearing on it are ideologically aligned despite being from wildly-varying subreddits. Here's some examples:

* A post on the star wars subreddit that is critical of recent star wars endeavors. This topic makes the top 10 most controversial posts on the site at least once per day. 

* Anything from r/politics that is critical of the democrats' treatment of Sanders  or praising Trump. Actually a quick scan just now shows that a positive post about Sanders on r/politics was the 47th most controversial post on the entire website in the last month.

* Opinions from radical feminists who are critical of transgender people

* Articles posted to r/canada reporting on Trudaeu's old groping scandal

* A post on r/conspiracy critical of the current russia hysteria

* **Every r/walkaway post**

That last one is how I ended up here today. I don't know if you all realize this but this subreddit is not only routinely registering the most controversial posts on reddit every day the past few weeks, but *most* of the controversial posts on r/all for that matter. And it doesn't really make sense right? If a subreddit that is about walking away from the democratic party is producing mostly posts that align with the purpose of the subreddit then these posts should be getting upvoted. Why are they the most controversial posts on reddit every day? I've figured out why because it recently happened to myself as well. 

I subscribe to a subreddit dedicated to exposing reddit censorship, r/redditcensors. You'll notice that r/redditcensors's subscriber count is very similar to that of your subreddit. (6.7k and 4.7k respectively) A few weeks ago I stumbled upon a post on r/politics which I felt really epitomized reddit's issue with censorship; r/politics, a subreddit dedicated to censoring all non-establishment/neocon/neolib content was now being forced to [police the far-left radicals in its community](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/8u4529/rpolitics_mods_remove_160_comment_defending/) who want to kill republicans/trump/trump supporters *because with the absence of any political opposition in their subreddit those radicals are now beginning to cannibalize the subreddit*. The post to r/redditcensors was extremely well-received. In just 6 minutes it had shot up to +15 upvoted and 100% which is insane for a subreddit of that size. However, then, as you can see, the post's score rapidly began to decline--again in a matter of minutes--until the +15 had been completely erased. 

It turned out that the post had entered r/all/rising and was now being exposed to an outside audience. But why did that outside audience entirely reject the post? Because r/all/rising is a political battleground dating back to when  it was publicized 2 years ago that the only way to "stop the_donald's monopoly on r/all" was to hit them where it hurt on r/all/rising. (Obviously admins removed them from r/all completely a few weeks after) And who are these political influencers? None other than the users of r/Againsthatesubreddits and r/Topmindsofreddit--the same subreddits that have a long history of posting r/walkway r/conspiracy r/greatawakening r/cringeanarchy r/kotakuinaction and r/jordanpeterson posts to their subreddit resulting in the target subreddit having its posts [downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/8ejemn/ragainsthatesubreddits_brigades_a_post_on_another/) straight to zero. Just take a look at the impact it's had on r/walkaway when this subreddit was [relentlessly attacked by topminds](https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/search?q=walkaway&amp;restrict_sr=on). If you replace 'walkaway' with any other aforementioned subreddit you'll get similar results.

But why are these harassment subreddits relentlessly targeting such a small subreddit like r/walkaway? Well, maybe it's for the same reason that the media is [calling the walkaway movement a russian conspiracy](http://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/179104930); maybe the people attacking us are in fact operating a conspiracy themselves. Take a look at the people who moderate r/againsthatesubreddits and r/topmindsofreddit. Notice anything? A lot of them seem to moderate r/SPLCenter as I pointed out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/8u4529/rpolitics_mods_remove_160_comment_defending/e1ckorn/). The SPLC is a group so radicalized that they were [recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8s1mg0/splc_apologizes_to_quilliam_maajid_nawaz_agrees/) ordered to pay $3milllion to a muslim man they accused of being "an anti-muslim extremist" simply for being critical of islamic extremism. Could it be possible that an organization that received hundreds of millions in donations on the cusp of the Trump hysteria era has created a network on reddit dedicated to harassing people who don't agree with its political agenda including users who are simply expressing their desires to walk away from the radicalization, the derangement, the hysteria, and now the harassment? Reddit's reaction to this subreddit is the ultimate validation that I've made the right decision in walking away

queenofmemphis Wanna hear your stories. 

I've never actually told anyone because i'm afraid they will shun me or something so most people still think i'm a liberal but i haven't been one since 2014.  How did you come out to your liberal friends/family after becoming conservative?
PoisonTaco I thought I'd share my story of walking away from both the Liberal and NDP parties in Canada. Maybe this will help Americans when evaluating their own politics as our parties share similarities to yours.

I remember growing up in the 1990's and 2000's when Canada was always more accepting and tolerant of other peoples. Where the USA was a melting pot, Canada didn't encourage assimilation so much. At a young age I've been exposed to many cultures, from being taken on field trips to learn about Natives, to going to a Sikh/Hindu temple to learn about them. My kindergarten teacher was very Japanese (and took some time to teach us about some of their spiritual practices). Throughout all my childhood and adolescence I never viewed different races as different people. In my mind we were all the same and I never really gave it any thought.

Canada has always had a history of diversity. Frankly, it's a miracle we've been able to make it work. Sure America has its history with slavery and wars with Mexico, but Canada was founded with 2/3rds of the country being English speaking Protestants and the other 1/3rd being French speaking Catholics. You can't find many other groups that hate each other that much. Especially in the 19th century. Considering how we've managed to get along fine without much bloodshed is incredible and completely underrated.

2008 was my first election and I voted NDP. Jack Layton was a charismatic leader and I supported the NDP on a number of social issues. In 2011 I again voted NDP. I had a growing disdain for the Conservatives as I was fully on board hating their environmental policies, muzzling scientists and refusal to speak to the press. I was staunchly against Stephen Harper at this point. In 2015 I strategically voted for the Liberals, seeing Trudeau as the best shot out outting Harper and giving my country a fresh government.

Since 2015 I could not be more ashamed of my country. Really I think this should be a warning to Americans looking at us north of the border. You want a taste of what the Democrats have to offer you in America? Look no further than Justin Trudeau. Sure you can look at Europe, but Europe is distant and has different population demographics. Canadians aren't that much different than Americans so it's easier to relate. For starters there's Bill C-16, the infamous transgender bill, the one Jordan Peterson got famous over. It's a bill claiming to be protecting transgender individuals in the country by opening up the door for government compelled speech.

The Liberal government has completely opened our borders. To the point where RCMP and CBSA (border patrol) act as bell hoppers, taking the luggage of illegal crossers. These people then get to claim refugee status (if you are coming here from the USA, you are NOT a refugee) and get access to full paid benefits, housing, access to jobs and more. All while Canadians find themselves having roadblocks to finding jobs. The Conservatives handed the Liberals a surplus in the budget, with an outlook to eliminate our debt. Trudeau's Liberals have managed to not only put us into debt but triple the deficits they promised. They're racking up Canada's debt so high it'll take generations to pay off. What are they spending their money on? Millions of dollars to returning ISIS fighters. Millions spent in aid to foreign countries and more on social welfare programs for immigrants and refugees. Canadian Citizens have to pay higher taxes and that tax money is going to everyone but Canadians.

I live in Northern BC so it's not so bad. If you watch Trailer Park Boys, people are kinda like that. More right leaning, into outdoorsy activities and such. But if I lived in Ontario or other major Liberal parts of the country I'd go mad and I'd seriously be considering immigrating to the USA.

I've walked away from both the Liberal and NDP parties in Canada. I will never vote for them again, and come 2019 I'll be voting Conservative for the first time. When I see Americans in this Walk Away movement, I can empathize and I think we share a lot in common. I hope my perspective is something fresh and there's something to be taken away from it. Walking Away: North of the Border Edition
myshpqmc Coward USA is too slow,which would make the war last long and make USA fail. China yuan is already down 4% to USA dollar.So the real tariff in trade would be 10%-4%*500/200=0% for the new 10% tariff on $200 billions of China goods.

Notice:$500 billions is the minimal of goods made in China exported to USA. So China yuan downing (or devaluation of China currency to America currency,now about 4% down) affects more than $500 billions goods exported to USA,but new tariffs expected only affects $200 billions goods exported to USA.So the result of the new tariffs on the whole trade of goods made in China but exported to America here is only 10%-4%*500/200=0%.


Maybe USA can keep torturing Children (news about immigrants) and infants (news about USA believing cow milk is much better than mother milk or breast milk for infants),and make China communists keep stealing $375 billions and millions of American jobs from USA every year,since all these would make America great again.

Is USA a coward failure only shouting 200 billion and shouting 500 billion with doing nothing real while China communists have been keeping beating USA?

The simplest example in life to see the unfair robbery nature of China communists...(rob money from Chinese,rob work from Ameircans)

If you transfer money from banks not in China (for example,D**) to China bank,Zero fee. But if you transfer back,that's to say,if you transfer money from China bank to banks not in China (for example,D**),very high fee.That's the fairness? So,we got to know why China bank would not like fair competition with other banks,and China communists did unfair competition very well.(By the way,there is a little fact: China top four communist banks are the four biggest and richest banks all over the world.)

China bank says:If you transfer money out of mainland,for example,if you transfer money to USA,the fee is 1‰，50￥ at least for each.And there is also tele fee,150￥ each time. And there also may be other fees.

So,if you are a Chinese and want to buy an American goods,you transfer 500￥ to your account outside China,and China bank just simply takes off more than 200￥ from you just because you want to buy an American goods. Moreover,if you take this American goods back to China,you may face high tax by China communists as well. So,we got to know why China goods would not like fair competition with USA goods,and China communists did unfair competition very well. (By the way,there is a little fact: China communists legally steal $375 billions and millions of American jobs from USA in 2017 by anti-freedom trade.)

And all above here lasts for decades!

Come on,Nazis and racists and communists,just ignore the truth,attack me and remove.

Seen in "China government has legally stolen 375.23 billions from USA in a single year..."http://bbs.aboluowang.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=1062885&amp;extra=page%3D1
 Walkaway topic:Russia and China communists interfere 2016 2020............
BlueRaven_01 Im not stating my opinion at this stage, just wondering if I'm right about what this sub is.    Am I right thinking this is a sub for ex-left people who are now trump supporters?
FreeBirdy2018 I've identified as a liberal my entire adult life. Pro freedom of speech, pro LGBTQ rights/marriage, pro immigration etc. During the Bush years I cut my political teeth watching shows like The Daily Show. All I cared about was living a good life and being decent and respectful to other people of any stripe.

I rejoiced when Obama became the President and even though I understood there were people who were unhappy with him I never ever assumed it was because they were racists. I've always at least tried to respect differing opinions, and if they were opinions I didn't care to engage with, I simply wouldn't. I'm a big proponent of being gracious in defeat. I'm aware that the political climate supports many different views and that some views prevail over others from time to time, election cycle to election cycle. My response to that whether for or against has always been to accept the outcome. After all, I can't always get my way, right?

So what if the Republicans won back the White House? The so-called pendulum almost always swings regularly every 8 years doesn't it? I mean, I certainly wasn't cheering in the streets but I remember thinking "*Oh well, thems the breaks, I guess it's back to the grind.*" But that isn't what happened, it was what I expected to happen, but as I'm sure we all feel around here something definitely snapped in 2016. The election was over, I was ready for things to back to normal again, but it seemed like everyone else was preparing to go to war. I have to admit at first it was kind of exciting, it felt like every day there was some new crazy thing happening and I'd get to read about it online. It wasn't scary, yet.


And that brings us to now.


Suddenly the political party I've affiliated with my entire life doesn't want me anymore because of my race/gender/sexual orientation?? I'm part of the problem? Riots in the streets, civil unrest on college campuses, harassment of government officials and public intellectuals?? *Stirring up conflict with foreign superpowers?!* How did it come to this? What in the holy hell is going on!? I was ready for things to go back to normal in 2016, and I'm still waiting for that to happen.

I'm not walking away from the Democratic party, or towards the Republican party. I'm walking away from the radical insanity and conflict. I don't care if you don't like the current administration, it will swing back eventually. We all have to take our political licks from time to time, and take them with dignity. I didn't start out wanting to walk away, I was pushed away. My experience over the last 24 months.
PitoStinko It’s official. /r/WalkAway has been blacklisted on The_Donald. Go ahead and try to link it. The Automoderator will remove the post if you check the thread from another user account. /r/WalkAway will not be featured on The_Donald’s sidebar.

Why have they refused? Their stipulation for partnership involved us appointing one of TD’s senior mods as our top mod. That would essentially give TD complete discretion over the moderation of WalkAway. While we love TD, we don’t agree that their ban-heavy tactics are a good fit for this community. The last thing we want to do is turn this sub into TD-lite. We want wavering democrats to have the privilege of discussion and learning about different political parties. We also oppose the tyranny of one group having complete control over every right-leaning sub.

Is this MAGA? The Democratic Party is a man on life-support. The WalkAway movement is the removal of the party’s feeding tube. The men and women forgotten by the DNC are finally casting aside the chains of their oppressors, like an abuse victim standing up for themselves. It takes courage to oppose the hateful radicals that have overtaken the left. The victims need strength, encouragement, visibility.

The_Donald has decided to censor the WalkAway movement. Instead of joining forces to defeat the democrats in November, they are choosing self-promotion and celebrity narcissism. This is unfortunate, but we will continue to run /r/WalkAway. We will continue to share testimonies from our great contributors. We will press our pillow over the face of the DNC. We will just have to do it ourselves, with the help of great members like you. Thanks.
 The_Donald Refuses a Partnership Unless We Hand Over Control of the Sub
AndyPickleNose A bunch of Trump supporters who claim they once supported any efforts to protect the environment, offer better healthcare, and create opportunities for all. Sure, the Democratic party has flaws, but you dipshits aren't fooling anyone by telling us you used to care and now you don't. Losers with daddy issues. What a bullshit sub
CuckSlayer1984 Here are some reasons I choose to #WalkAway from the Democratic Party: the left has become coopted by mob mentality and groupthink of extremist factions that have become violent and verbally abusive to those who are allies but who do not think like them or who make suggestions on improving their messages or being more reasonable with their demands. Instead, these groups will castigate these allies, they will attempt to "dox" them (put up their public information and attempt to get them fired), they will shame you, they will shout your opposing views down, they will excommunicate you from their groups unless you conform your opinion to their liking. 

It is even worse when you're a straight white man because you are a zero on the scale of victimhood which has become the game of the Democratic Party and the extremist groups of the Alt-Left wherein only the highest levels of victims have the right to speak and everyone else must remain silent or suffer the ramifications for being so bold as to voice an opinion which generally results in derision as the mob mentality takes hold and virtue signaling ensues and you are shouted down and shamed. 

I spent thousands of dollars trying to get Bernie Sanders elected, and I never voted for Trump (I wrote Bernie Sanders in for the general election). I eventually started to return to the Republican Party after I ran for city council appointment and ran on a campaign of bringing good-paying jobs to our city through my connections with Silicon Valley companies and construction companies to build training facilities in trades skills and high tech by using investors in these industries who would then get returns on their investments by locals paying for the training programs and then developing a skilled local workforce that would be attractive to have companies relocate and/or set up field offices in our city to get more tax revenue to improve our infrastructure and to expand jobs locally even further as well as expand our economy. I told this primary message of my campaign to the AFL-CIO (Teamsters Union) to which their regional director and assistant director told me that they liked my message but they'd never support a straight white man for the city council. Then, the night of the appointment, the AFL-CIO director went to the dias and threatened to sue my city for millions of dollars if they didn't hold a special election or unless they appointed a minority woman for the seat. So, the city council appointed a minority woman to avoid the political and legal shakedowns. Now, I actually wasn't so upset that they didn't appoint me as I just had a message and had NO proven track record of actually bringing high-end jobs into a city, but the city council ignored another man who HAD DONE THAT: the city council refused to appoint the former mayor of Los Gatos who BROUGHT IN NETFLIX AND THOUSANDS OF SIX FIGURE SALARIES to the city of Los Gatos and instead appointed a minority woman who had no proven track record of creating good-paying jobs. My city's primary General Plan goal is to bring good-paying jobs into the city and they had a golden opportunity to appoint a man with a proven track record to do that but they chose identity politics over real solutions. That was the beginning of my movement away from the Democratic Party and their factions like AFL-CIO that bullied the city council. 

Along the way, I had tried to reach out to other groups and only to be attacked for how much I make, that I don't deserve my six figure salary, I don't deserve to own my house, that I never worked for what I have and that it is all because of my "white privilege." So, I got fed up, I said "enough", and I chose to walk away. I still support healthcare reform and finding a universal healthcare solution if it can be done, but I'm open to alternatives, I support a woman's right to choose and to have control of her own medical decisions of her own body, I still support marriage equality and equal rights for the LGBTQ, I would like to see us reform our prison system and I have many ways that could be done such as tax incentives for businesses to employ parolees to reduce recidivism, I still believe in supporting organized labor so long as the union bosses aren't crooks and actually help the workers, I support legal immigration but not illegal immigration, and I still support a solution into investing in our crumbling infrastructure to create millions of good-paying jobs to expand our economy we just need to find the correct delivery mechanism. 

So, I am probably a moderate Republican and I am happy to work with anyone who has reasonable approaches to find solutions to our country's challenges, including working with our president, as I too want to make America great again.  Bernie Sanders Supporter that Chose to #WalkAway
2FingersBerben I'm a former entertainment journalist who became a mental health advocate over three years ago. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primaries and Hillary Clinton in the general election. Since then I've come to see the extreme rhetoric from the Democratic Party towards opposing viewpoints as going against the First Amendment, a right I've held dear my entire life. I tried to talk to my friends about it and was shut down, then I saw my friends become increasingly violent and unhinged. I stopped speaking up because I was afraid of the personal consequences.

When I saw Brandon Straka's original #WalkAway video, I was inspired. Here was someone who had the courage I lacked, he was willing to risk the backlash from his friends and family by publicly outing himself as someone who still believes in freedom of thought. Somehow that's become a radical notion lately, but because of his courage I decided to announce to my friends and family that I was walking away from the Democratic Party. I never expected my own story to go viral. I am a real person, I'm not a Russian bot, and you are welcome to Ask Me Anything you'd like about my journey walking away from the Democratic Party. I'm Vanessa Berben, I decided to #WalkAway from the Democratic Party this year, Ask Me Anything...
gaylabaer It's a pleasure to be around others who have undergone the same sort of #WalkAway transformation that I experienced in 2015.  I don’t think anyone understands THIS feeling but others who’ve walked away! 

Here's my transformation story. 

I'm married to a conservative and a few of my close friends are conservative - my dad is too. Until July 2015, I was EXTREMELY pigheaded Democrat. No one could tell me anything. THEN Kate Steinle happened.

I watched closely for Obama to respond (I set up a Google Alert for Kate to monitor mentions). After all he acknowledged a punk-thug that robbed a convenience store and wound up shot by a cop. He did that in 3 days. Three days, a week, a month went by, not ONE word of Kate. He did however take time to send 46 personal handwritten letters to prison inmates. STILL NO mention of Kate.

Then Josue Flores, 12-year-old in Houston was stabbed by a black man on his way home from school. Surely Obama would acknowledge an innocent Hispanic boy, right? Wrong! To this day, not one word by the left.

Kate DIED in a sanctuary city at the hands of an illegal immigrant that had been deported FIVE times and got off with a smack on the hand. Since her death, sanctuary cities and their funding/support had increased under Obama, essentially slapping Kate's family in the face OVER and OVER.

I KNEW Donald Trump was MY President the very day he said Kate's name! MY God gave me THAT sign that Mr. Trump was the one to make sure REAL victims like Kate NEVER go unnoticed, and the *causes* that murdered them NEVER go unaddressed. Kate was just the beginning of my ability to see the grotesque amount of corruption and deception Hillary and those like her are capable of. I have researched and researched, well beyond conservative websites which I RARELY read - Hillary is by far the most corrupt candidate to EVER run for President and I absolutely cannot fathom why anyone would EVER consider supporting her. I just can NOT see it, and I used to love her. 

When I heard about "plantation politics" and began to understand the logic and agenda - I began to see how I had been brainwashed into believing the clever tactics to segregate and label people based on religion, race, gender and sexual preference. It's very clever and many people think it's a "progressive" effort toward "unity and equality" but Saul Alinsky teaches that segregated, smaller groups are easier to control (i.e. become Loyal voters)

The shift was happening and I didn't even know it. It wasn't until March 2016 when, because of my personal blog, I was called by Fox &amp; Friends. In a pre-appearance call and email, they asked "what changed?" I tried to pinpoint *WHEN?* and truly didn't know. My husband said he knew *exactly* when. He is a staunch conservative who kept silent while observing my shift. He was afraid if he pointed it out, I would resist the transformation that was happening. (I appeared on Fox &amp; Friends and on Risk &amp; Reward as a Democrat voting for Trump)

Once I started seeing the clever, political tactics at play, I began researching and writing about all the lies I used to believe. I wanted and NEEDED to know the truth. That goes for BOTH sides by the way! I still lean liberal in some ways, but these aren't the Democrats I knew and supported my entire adult life. When it comes to unity and equality, I'm a smart enough woman to know that unity can not be achieved through the voluntary segregation, victimization and divisiveness the new liberals promote. We are ALL American's - labels mean NOTHING! 

Now I'm on a mission to *Red Pill* as many pigheaded liberals as I possibly can by sharing nothing but the absolute truth! Once upon a time, I WAS for HER. Rally-going, sign-holding, shirt-wearing FOR HER!
Hollywoodv1 From original American values to the Russian ideology that's currently being pushed by this hashtag.

I'm voting democrat because Russians support the GOP.

Don't be a traitor to America. Vote Democrat. Let's all walk away!
shortcut_dummy So this is a group for people who have decided to leave the Democratic Party. You don't agree with its stances, it doesn't align with your beliefs and values etc etc. That's cool, I get that.  My question is, does this also change your ideology in some way?


If you supported LGBT rights before, does the behavior of the Democratic party change your views on that? How could it influence your stance on climate change? Abortion? Healthcare? Etc etc. If your stances haven't changed, are you comfortable identifying as/voting Republican?


TLDR I guess: Are you walking away from the party or from your ideology as a liberal? Does leaving the Democrats make you consider yourself a Republican? Legitimate question from a liberal, no disrespect intended
Bubblepop123 Until fairly recently, I have always considered myself to be a fairly left-leaning individual. I voted for Obama in 2008 and again in 2012, but I feel like from here on out, I can no longer go forwards and label myself a liberal. This realization came to me pretty profoundly one morning when I suddenly realized that my current situation shouldn't be attributed to my own lack of work ethic and education, and is instead the result of women (Femanazi's), Mexican immigrants, and cultural Marxisists. Although I have historically been in favor of "marginalized groups", I now realize that white people are the ones who are currently being oppressed, and this is why I'm decided to #walkaway. Why I decided to walk away.

Shredder13 The lies, the unpatriotic fervor, the rampant racism and anti-intellectualism. I just can’t anymore. I’m saying fuck it and walking away from the GOP for good. Hope those bunch of traitors enjoy their last remaining days in power.  I just can’t stand it anymore. I’m going to #WalkAway
EngiNERD1988 So we know that ATM Trumps approbal rating is higher than Obama's at this same time in office.

Yet Trump gets 90% negative coverage while Obama got nothing but praise from the media....

It's almost as if the entire media is purley liberal propaganda.... Weird.

What do you guys think? MEDIA BIAS
PitoStinko Thanks!  Send it through mod mail again, we got it all cleaned up from the brigade. Whoever sent us those banners. Would you please send them again?
rolexthewonderdog During the 2016 Election It was being used on some voting machines. I can't remember the Voting Watchdog group that exposed it but I'm sure we will hear from them again in 2018. The Algorithms were set to 4 votes to count for 1 in Democrat favor. Always in favor of the Dems. Oops was not an excuse. Some were stopped before implemented but others were not. If it wasn't for the Tsunami of voters for Trump it would have worked. People got smart &amp; asked for Paper Ballots, recorded voting machine numbers that they voted at. Anyone that worked at the Polls paid attention to anyone &amp; everyone around the ballots. looked in trash cans (found some). Watched the buses &amp; where they were from. They caught some people trying to vote out of their district therefore voted multiple times. Even caught some from out of state. I mean all that the "People" could do to stop fraud was being done &amp; still according to DHS at least 1.1 million of illegal voters voted. When Obama said on Nationwide TV to a dreamer that she could vote without being a citizen that was all that was needed. When Republicans asked for Voter ID law they were called racist &amp; every other name on the list. So they couldn't get the law passed. The Dems were pretty much telling minorities that they were way too stupid to get an Identification card even though you need one for any government services. Once again locking in the victim narrative. I hope I'm not talking out of turn here but this is important even if you vote Independent. With all of the Russian bot crazy going on maybe it will backfire &amp; they now will have no excuse &amp; want to verify voters or they will blow their whole Russia Russia Russia narrative. I can just see the Logic Train pulling up at the liberal station &amp; them just letting it go by. Anyway kids, you are all awesome &amp; courageous! I say all this with love &amp; good intentions.  Thank you for your time. Luv &amp; Hugz G'Ma You know now that #walkaway is seen as the enemy by the Left &amp; we are all Russian Bots the upvote count will be tweeked by what they call "Fractional Magic". It will also be tried in the 2018 election. read on....
WarOfTheFanboys That’s 5000 fed up with the hate and corruption. 5000 ready to turn away from the herd and forge their own path. 5000 who only want what’s best for them and their country, and have realized they won’t find it with the Democratic Party.

This community is composed of five thousand real Americans. These Americans will NOT be voting democrat this year. Some are abstaining from the political process. Some have gone third party. Many have made the switch to Republican after seeing how great the country is doing under Trump. Also because Republicans are richer, drive nicer cars, live in beautiful homes, sleep with gorgeous women, are more successful, better looking, and do way more things with their lives, but I digress.

The bottom line is: The Democrat Party is the epitome of stale ideology, violent rhetoric, and corrupt politics. They will try to bully and shame you for wrongthink, but you only need to look at the patriots around you to understand that we are ALL Americans. I’d like to personally thank everyone of /r/WalkAway for your bravery and your participation. Your voice is my voice. Together, we will make this country better than it’s ever been before. Thank you and God Bless. /r/WalkAway Now 5000 Strong
OnlyControlYourself FACT: Trump cheated on ALL of his wives. This is the future you are voting for.﻿

Never forget the president leads America and is a role model for all children. 

"I'm automatically attracted to beautiful [women]—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything."  #walkaway but don't walkaway to the GOP, we are better than that
oaklandmike How many Russian trolls does it take to convince the mindless sheep that Democrats actually "walk away"?...About 5,000. Pure Horseshit
throwaway28806847199 Assuming you're not a bot, being a part of this hashtag means that you 1. are or were a democrat and 2. looked at the republican party and either thought "wow, that is a complete shitshow and clearly far worse on every level than the democrats, and I want to be a part of it" or you didn't think at all and just bandwagoned along here with your incel friends.

I've also learned that some of you support the "it's not just about leaving dems to become a republican, it's also about just leaving the dems". Are you telling me that in this political climate, with treasonous bullshit, indictments, and new scandals happening nearly on the daily with Trump and his campaign and his administration that somehow now you think voting non-dem (be honest, republican) is the way to go?

Nearly all of these posts are straight false information and the comments are just people being assholes. There's no substance here. This subreddit is so fucking dumb
bornfree1688 I was a big Bernie supporter but gladly voted for Hillary over Trump. After the election I joined the Democratic Socialists of America and knew I wanted to get involved in politics. I decided not to attend any protests or anything and spent my time learning more.  I started reading Noam Chomsky, Marx, the Frankfurt school etc. I was convinced capitalism and the west was the root of all evil.   So how has my mind changed since then?   

1. I was clueless about economics and capitalism. Fiscal conservatism used to seem so cruel, I really thought they just wanted to take stuff away from people. In reality, liberals do not look at the effectiveness of their policies and support things that sound good but have disastrous consequences (read Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell). If they care about the poor, why are they setting poverty traps?  
2. Our freedoms, the constitution, and the rule of law is vastly more important than policy preferences. Government is limited in what they can accomplish. The most important thing for our democracy is that government follows and enforce the law and protects our freedoms. The Eric Holder DOJ was a paradigm of prioritizing progressive policy over the law and the results were appalling (read Obama's Enforcer by John Fund).  
3. The left hates reason and logic. They're so sure they're right that they don't need to explain themselves. Why is logic important? This is a fair question because people can win an argument and still be wrong. Logic is mostly about being a clear about what you're saying so people can communicate productively instead of talking past each other. Liberals prefer to avoid arguments and use virtue signaling and appeals to sentiment. Good arguments are such a problem for the left that it's no wonder they don't support freedom of speech and thought. They know logical people will disagree with them so they revert to violence and shaming dissenters.  
4. THE NEWS IS FAKE. The last straw for me was seeing how the media reported on the family separation "crisis". Of all of the tragic things in Central America the media could bring attention to why that? They don't care about children, it's about midterm talking points and hating Trump. Also, I found out I was mislead for the entirety of Obama's presidency. He was a colossal failure and did so many things to hurt our country but you would never know about it if you listened to the mainstream media. When Fox investigated his major scandals they were dismissed as right wing conspiracy theorists. Fast forward to Trump and the media makes it look like the sky is falling every time Trump sneezes.  
5. Why are we concerned with offending terrorists who kill innocent civilians? Why can't we be honest about radical Islam? We can't sacrifice truth because of hurt feelings. The fact that many of us were reluctant to tell anyone we were walking away shows how toxic civic life has become thanks to political correctness and group think. And instead of communicating with us they assume we're Russian bots!  

A couple of weeks before I found the #walkaway movement I was certain that the country was filled with people like me who were fed up with the left but didn't feel comfortable (or safe) speaking out.  Democrats think the blue wave is a done deal, but I'm expecting a blue hemorrhage. It's so relieving and inspiring to see so many people who experienced the same awakening as me. Here is my #walkaway story
[deleted] [deleted] Can someone explain this movement to me?
georock hi all

I walked away from the democratic party a few years back for all the reasons you are all here. I think it is ten times harder to leave today so wanted to say how much I admire your courage. stay strong, you are all an inspiration  I admire your courage
PitoStinko So the new do or die stance of democrats is abolishing ICE.  They believe that ICE is a fascist arm of the government that is only there to kick brown people out of the country.  That is totally wrong, but that is what the left believes.  So let's just say for arguments sake that Hillary wins in 2020, we abolish ICE and open up our borders.  What then?  What nation in South or Central America would you ideally like to see America shift toward?  Socialist Venezuela, murder capital of the world Brazil, or the corrupt drug nation Mexico?  Which country should seek to model America toward with an open southern border? Question for dems about their new stance on open borders and abolishing ICE
FlacOrGtfo Considering I voted for Trump in 2016, the WalkAway movement is certainly something that I can get behind. I regret to inform everyone that the vaccines, although an important technology, are being abused using modern ingredients. Donald Trump has stated that vaccines cause autism and you can see him talk about it on YouTube. Donald Trump is wealthy and has access to things that we don't, such as safe vaccines. I wrote an empirical research paper on the neurological effects of vaccine ingredients for school. The vaccines are being used for population control.

Vaccine Ingredients Can Cause Harm

Since  the eighteenth century, vaccinations have prevented significant numbers of people from becoming ill. Vaccines can contain different ingredients that can cause various side effects. Aluminum adjuvants and Thimerosal have been proven to cause neurological damage (Dórea 927-938). A scientist with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that a specific vaccine can be attributed to causing autism   (Thompson). The number of vaccine doses a country administers to its infants correlates with that country’s infant mortality rate (Goldman and Miller 1420-1424). Although vaccinations are not inherently harmful, vaccines can contain ingredients that harm people in a statistically   significant manner.

One of the earliest  vaccinations for smallpox was performed in  England by Edward Jenner on  James Phipps in 1796. Edward Jenner would  expose a person to cowpox,  which subsequently inoculated that individual  to smallpox in a manner  that involved little risk; cowpox is relatively  mild compared to  smallpox (Rusnock 19). Since then, science has allowed  for new  vaccinations and vaccination ingredients to emerge.

Modern  vaccines use different ingredients, such as adjuvants. Aluminum is used as an adjuvant because it stimulates the immune  system’s response  to an antigen (Dey and Srivastava 1466). According to  Dórea, who wrote a  paper on the neurological effects of Thimerosal,  studies involving  mice have demonstrated that exposure to aluminum  adjuvants and  Thimerosal are consistently correlated with neurological  damage. He  stated that, “it is worth mentioning that the brain of adult  mice can  accumulate substantial amounts of Al derived from vaccines . . .   indeed, adjuvant-Al provoked significant impairments in motor functions   and diminished spatial memory capacity” (927-938). Furthermore, studies   have shown that there is a link between vaccine ingredients and neurological damage in humans. Thimerosal is a molecule containing   mercury that is added to vaccines as a preservative. Children that have   been exposed to mercury from Thimerosal-containing Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines within the first fifteen months of life   are significantly correlated with a diagnosis for a pervasive   developmental disorder, such as autism spectrum disorders, compared to   controls (Geier et al. 34). This shows that there is substantial evidence to suggest that Thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism.

The  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a study to   investigate a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Dr.   William Thompson was a Senior Scientist at the CDC and was involved in   the study that was published in 2004 that concluded that there is no   link between the MMR vaccine and autism. In August 2014, Dr. Thompson   stated in an online Morgan Verkamp press release that, “I regret that my   coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our   2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data   suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine   before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism . . . I believe   that the final study protocol was not followed” (Thompson). According to   Dr. Thompson, the CDC study originally did find a link between the MMR   vaccine and autism. The article creates concerns with regards to  medical  ethics because it was published without the data that  demonstrates that  the MMR vaccine causes autism.

Goldman  and Miller have identified that countries that give greater  vaccine  doses to infants also have a higher infant mortality rate. This   correlation can be observed when vaccination requirements and   recommendations were increasingly introduced in the US during the 1960s.   Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was a term that emerged in the  late  1960s to describe an increasing medical phenomenon. There is some   evidence linking SIDS to vaccines. Two-thirds of babies that have died   from SIDS received the diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus toxoid (DPT)   vaccination prior to death. Seventy percent of those deaths occurred   within three weeks after being vaccinated against DPT (1420-1424). Not   only is there a link between vaccine ingredients and autism in infants,   there is also an association between vaccine ingredients and sudden   infant death.

The vaccine is an important  technology that can safely benefit  society. Modern vaccine  ingredients, such as Thimerosal and aluminum,  are consistently  associated with harm. It would be ideal for future  vaccine research and  development to aspire to achieve safer vaccine  ingredients than the  ones used today.

This article concerns the importance of effective   adjuvants in vaccine research and development. Dey and Srivastava   describe different adjuvants and the resulting immune system responses.   As a result, the article explains the purpose of an adjuvant in   vaccines. Since modern vaccines use adjuvants, that ingredient should be   explained considering it is relevant.

This article describes   the neurological effects of vaccine ingredients such as Thimerosal and   aluminum adjuvants. In vitro and in vivo studies were used to   investigate the neurological effects. Dórea determines that Thimerosal   and aluminum are harmful vaccine ingredients.

This article indicates that infants can develop a   pervasive developmental disorder, such as autism, if they have received a   Thimerosal-containing vaccine. Controls were used in the study, which   establishes credibility for the article. Geier et al. study data   suggests that Thimerosal is correlated with neurological harm.

This article shows that there is a   consistent association between the amount of vaccines a country   administers to infants and the infant mortality rate. Although Goldman   and Miller state that the study does have limitations, they show that   increased vaccinations in the US was followed by increased SIDS.

It's worth noting that the MMR vaccines contains neither Thimerosal nor aluminum. It was still determined that the vaccine causes autism. Considering the blatant corruption that has been revealed, they could be adding ingredients to the vaccine without listing them. #WalkAway from the vaccines
rolexthewonderdog G'Ma has learned a powerful lesson &amp; I feel kind of stupid because I know better. For the 1st time in my life I have experienced on a personal level the of unhinged hate the liberals have a visceral need to spew. I allowed myself to be sucked in to their sick world by responding to their insults of you, me &amp; your movement. By doing that I bowed to their level &amp; gave them my power. After all their motivation is to disrupt &amp; they do it by making you angry. Hurting you makes them happy. To engage them is an exercise in futility. Common sense has taken a leave of absence where liberals are concerned.  I found myself getting very angry &amp; I'm too old for that shit. So I'm going to do what G'Ma has always done. Ignore people who want nothing more than to hurt &amp; derail forward movement. Have you really looked at them lately?  Always angry. So what if they say we're bots, paid Republicans, uneducated poor people, Nazi's ,Bigots, racists, or all the "Phobes etc. Just their hateful harassment validates why you are part of the walkaway movement. I will be here as a HUGE fan pouring out admiration instead. So keep on with your Badass selves. You are being true to yourselves &amp; that is powerful no matter what they throw at you. Luv &amp; Big Hugs. G'Ma
P.S. Now that I have said that I won't engage, the haters will work overtime to try &amp; bait me. Just remember, when you are over the target you catch the most flack. I will no longer engage the haters in this sub. I will however support you awesome utterly fearless people any way I can.

doofface99 Hey ya'll!

This WalkAway movement is still growing. It continues to grow each day, both here on Reddit and elsewhere. As we look forward to the AMAs that are coming up on this sub, I thought it would be nice to look back on all the amazing WalkAway testimonies that we have seen here on r/WalkAway so far. I've been saving them all and am ready to dump them all down below (Man it took so long to gather them all up...). Since the start of this subreddit, we have had... wait for it... 99 WalkAway testimonies submitted! 

These are the people who are fed up with the Democrats, the hostility, the hate, the corruption. I encourage you all to pick a few and read them. They all provide an interesting perspective. Many of these were submitted during the brigade and therefore didn't get the attention they deserved. It's time to shine the spotlight on them again. I hope you all enjoy.

rolexthewonderdog When observing wild animals in their natural habitat it's a bad idea to feed them. And now I will be called 1) a Russian bot 2) a paid Russian following the Kremlin's orders 3) a paid Republican to divide the liberal cause. They just hate it when people think for themselves. No one could possibly leave the party voluntarily. It couldn't be the Nazi tactics they embrace. It couldn't be they got sick of spending every waking hour in a unhinged rage. It couldn't be the extreme childish behavior from the leaders at the top when they wouldn't tolerate that kind of behavior from their own children. As John Podesta said of their voters: After decades of conditioning they have succeeded in keeping the voters "Uninformed &amp; Compliant". Carry on Brave Warriors. You know you're over the target when you catch the most flack. Luv G'Ma The haters in this sub actually think their opinions matter.

Wolfyminecraft I'll still support the democratic party because they're the least worst and we can at least try to reform it from the inside, with the DSA and stuff. But hey I changed ideologies.

([archived copy](http://archive.is/W6vgw) in case comment is removed)

As per usual, they're calling everyone who doesn't agree with their politics a nazi, fascist, white supremacist/racist, etc and openly calling for and praising violence against them.

Looking forward to Reddit's completely non-biased and fair enforcement of their site-wide rules concerning inciting and promoting violence in that thread. /s Leftists in /r/oakland celebrate violence against Trump supporter meet-up in Oakland
BadBoySwag420 Hello.


Friendly nerdy dude here. I posted my story on why I left the "progressive left" or "the tolerant left" or the "liberal left" and people freaked the fuck out.


I see this sub and the videos and it's truly fascinating to see people from all walks of life saying basically what I said. There are thousands of people abandoning the left.

Heres proof I volunteered and voted for sanders:

https://ibb.co/kWq8dd

https://ibb.co/dmG3By



What i learned was that there are liberals who absolutely refuse to accept that people can change their minds. They absolutely dont believe in facts and reality even when it's in their face confronting them.


If anyone wants to ask me anything you can look at my most recent sub posts and read my story there. 


I'm just so glad I'm no longer apart of something that was so toxic and damaging to me as a person and my life.  I walked away from the left and reaped the fucking whirlwind
DreamRare Hello #WalkAway Reddit! It's An0maly. I'm a news analyst, hip-hop artist &amp; social media influencer with over 250 million video views! I try to add some peace of mind &amp; optimism to the crazy news cycle &amp; spread love, wisdom, truth &amp; unity to the best of my ability.

k3wlmeme I've been a very good friend to many. Loyal, trustworthy, honest, a good listener, present in times of need, and reliable. I used to be a liberal until 2015, but when I had my eyes opened, I began to make a shift libertarian (this is the lily pad ex liberals use before admitting they align best with conservatism, from my experience), and then quietly coming out as a conservative through conversation, Facebook posts, etc.

Given my track record as a good friend, the way some of my friends reacted shocked me. Instead taking a moment to consider they might have had the wrong idea about *conservatives*, they instead figured they had the wrong idea about *me* -they decided  that I was a sexist, racist, homophobe, etc. What the media has done to destroy our families, friendships and relationships is nothing short of evil.

Anyone else experience this? A showerthought I had about coming out as a conservative to my friends

mnek03 I used to be brainwashed by the left a couple of years ago. Every mention in college was about ''progressive values'' which I thought was good. I voted for Hillary but failed to see that she just played the woman card and tried to fool the American public. These few years everything is coming into place, with the democrats' blatant hypocrisy falling into place with Roseanne and James Gunn. Democrats have never done anything good for America! Only falling to the corporate interests and selling us to Iran and other countries. They also control the FAKE NEWS MSM which is totally garbage. Never been more ashamed in my life to vote for traitors!

Took the red-pill in 2017 and havent felt better since! My entire outlook has changed and I no longer need to be imprisoned by the dems. Trump has been such a great president these few years that I think 2 terms isn't enough!! He's done more in 1 week than 8 freaking years of Obummer. I really think he needs to bring down the hammer of justice immediately and send Hillary to jail right now! Skip the court nonsense, Shillary will use her deep state to escape the courts. He just needs to send the FBI over and imprison her right now. Been lurking for some time in over here and finally decided to share my #walkaway here. Never seen such a bonded community who really cares for one another. Thank you (pedes?) and MAGA!

Leonlecouer How's it going? Hi Russia and fake Democrats!
rolexthewonderdog Ridicule Is man's most potent weapon. There is no defense. It's irrational. It's infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy to give up. The Liberal handbook "Rules for Radicals" by Saul Alinsky. Hillary's favorite Mentor. Rule #5 Even if they have never read it, it's part of the indoctrination.
rolexthewonderdog I had copies of their leaked Strategy. Harassment at every level. Using both people &amp; Bots. But my computer crashed awhile ago &amp; I lost it (carelessly didn't have backup). It is out there though. It was almost a year ago. I will look for it. Maybe someone here could help. Maybe post it when you do. Of course if it hasn't been scrubbed by Brock/Soros &amp; Media Matters. Looks like Davis Brock's Shareblue Correct the Record "Nerd virgins" (That's what Podesta calls them) &amp; their little downvoting Bots are at work tonight.
RealLanceGunnin Thanks This sub is digsuting to me and what you all are doing is harming political discourse. Please ban me I don't even want to be allowed to post on this propadanga subreddit please.
rolexthewonderdog Rule#13  Pick a target. Freeze it. Personalize it. Cut off the support network. Isolate the target from sympathy. It's easier to go after people &amp; not institutions. People feel the hurt faster than institutions. In the outrage against ICE &amp; the immigration system they have gone after the institution, the President &amp; his supporters. They feel they have accomplished both.  From the Liberal Handbook "Rules for Radicals". This guy was a favorite mentor of Hillary's. Even if they haven't read it, it's part of the indoctrination. Knowing the tactics they use will help to identify them.
maluminse Walkaway was the sentiment of progressives that the corporate democrats are closet republicans. It's a progressive liberal stance. 

Many of the posts here appear to be conservatives rejecting liberals/progressives ideology. Walkaway hijack?
SoulsJunkie ....now it seems to be a place where people come to bash 'libtards', talk about how much they worship Donald Trump, and talk about how they never walked away or that they walked away decades ago, before the left went crazy.  I'm also seeing a lot of science deniers, conspiracy theorists, and people who are just as loony as the people on the left that I walked away from.   In the beginning, I could relate to this movement completely.  That isn't true any more. When WalkAway started, I thought it was for people on the left who decided they no longer wanted a part of what the left has become and decided to WalkAway from it....
dankbonkripper78_ I know this subreddit is oftener viewed as controversial. I’m not trying to preach my opinion on here, I just want to understand yours. What is the walk away movement?
chiohkeh I am a Black conservative who twice voted for Barack Obama simply because everyone around me said that Republicans were horrible people and everyone around me was liberal. I was living in a big leftist bubble and still am for the most part because I work for a university and live in the most left-leaning city in my state. Being a black conservative, who produces a conservative YouTube show called Consider Culture, isn't always easy. However, I do it because I firmly believe that it is the right thing to do. Conservatives have to spread the word and explain why our ideas are best for the Culture here in America.

As a teenager, I grew up with a single mother and engaged in criminal behaviors. My father was still involved but I only saw him on holidays and summers. He is a psychiatrist and my mother was an educator. I didn't grow up poor. I went to private school but still chose to engage in foolishly dangerous behaviors. I also later worked amongst many morally bankrupt individuals in the music industry as a Hip-Hop producer. 

Today I work at an HBCU which is a Historically Black College and/or University. Almost no one here thinks the way I do. I, like many other conservatives, am often silent in the company of liberals at work for fear of retaliation and ostracization. I sometimes fear for my future at my job. It's not easy being quiet as they talk poorly of Trump and folks on the right. I do not hide my views online and many of my coworkers and students follow me there. Some even try and have light debates with me from time to time. The internet has become my outlet, my hope, my passion, and, hopefully, my future. I will not hide who I am.

The #WalkAway movement has seemed to help strengthen the voices of people like me. My hope is that, together, conservatives and libertarians will come out of the shadows and fight against the ideas that we know have been harmful to American culture. 

My show, "Consider Culture", mainly focuses on trying to explain to folks that many Blacks in America have things all wrong. Racism isn't our number one problem. It isn't even in the top ten in a list of black problems in America. The major problems for blacks in America stem from poor cultural habits. My hope is to make them understand that Democrats and their policies have been a major hindrance to progress. My hope is that people will eventually forget the racism narrative and Consider Culture.

 I'm Chi Brown of Consider Culture. Here's my #WalkAway story. Ask Me Anything!
Meowsticgoesnya Pedophilia, rape jokes, SOMETIMES LITERAL DEATH CULTS, they've gone way too far. We must stop The Left before they cause ANOTHER 9/11. But this time it will be on 7/11, I'm sure even the Islamists appreciate memes.  Years ago I was part of the right, then I became a dumb liberal, and now I'm #WalkingAway, The democrat party has gone too far.
icedicks Maybe it's hard to get them to post their stories since they only start voting Democrat after they die. What about those walking away from the right?
TotesTax Literally no one thinks Hillary will run in 2020. For one she is 2 years younger than Trump. Which is old. Very old. And THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. 

Tag me with AOC if anything.  Ummm. ya'll know that you don't run again when you lose in the General right?

PitoStinko The Democrat Socialism according to current [Democrat leaders](https://www.businessinsider.com/dnc-tom-perez-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democratic-socialist-future-2018-7), is the future of the Democrat Party.  Democrat Socialism, not to be confused with [National Soclialsm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism), is not the Communism or Socialism, that we know from history according to [their platform](https://www.dsausa.org/what_is_democratic_socialism).

**They are an entirely new Grassroots Movement, made in America and for Americans.**

After spending hours combing through the platforms and positions of these DSA hopefuls, I actually agree.  This is something much different, and unlike anything the world has seen before.  We all know the *good stuff*, the bait that they hang in the faces of voters.  [The free housing, college, and healthcare](https://twitter.com/Ocasio2018/status/1022846124066066433).  Now they are always very vague about how they will accomplish this, we know they want to [raise taxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SOY4PT6oW0), although it is never clear as to what degree they would do so.

**THIS POST IS NOT ABOUT THE FREEBIES!  THIS POST IS ABOUT WHAT IS NOT TALKED ABOUT.  WHAT THE LENINISTS IN THE MEDIA DO NOT WANT YOU TO SEE, WHAT IS HIDDEN BEHIND THE VEIL OF THE FEEL-GOODS!** 

This is no longer just something to be *concerned* about.  Your own country is being stolen from you by sleight of hand right before your eyes, and we are still in meme mode, high off of our win from 2016!  Hundreds of thousands of Americans proudly support the DSA, and most of these guppy's don't even know what they are asking for!  The bait of *freebies** was dangled in front of their faces, and they bit, hook, line, and sinker.  The time now is to speak out.  Show these leftists what it really is they are asking for.  I will provide you with all the tools and references you need.  Engage them, speak out about it on social media, show America what the DSA is really calling for.  What I am about to cover is not coming from Sean Hannity, this is coming right out of mouths of these monsters!

**EVERYTHING WILL BE SOURCED**

I am not an op-ed writer for Fake News CNN.  I have screenshots, and I will leave sources at the bottom of the write-up to show that I have doctored nothing.

[SOURCE](https://salazarforsenate.com/issues)

[FURTHER READING](https://cynthiafornewyork.com/issue/drivers-licenses-for-all/)

That's right folks, if traffic and pollution wasn't already a problem, the DSA wants to accelerate the problem by several magnitudes by giving tens of millions of illegals driver's licences across the country.  Don't ask questions though, because only a racist would deny an undocumented immigrant the right to drive.

- [Democrat Socialists want to SHUT DOWN jails and put dangerous criminals back on the streets](https://imgur.com/zW7642t)

[SOURCE](https://salazarforsenate.com/issues)

From their own platform, the DSA wants to end jails and private prisons, and put millions of criminals across the country back on the streets.  Maybe these criminals can show up at voting polls and ensure the DSA win in every district.

- [Democrat Socialists want to dictate what is portrayed in our media and DISARM THE POLICE](https://imgur.com/acCtkyT)

[SOURCE](https://www.ringelsteinformaine.com/fight-racial-inequality)

I guess this would be fair.  After all, we wouldn't want anything bad to happen to the millions of criminals around the country that we put back on the streets.  We know that police **unfairly target criminals**, and we can't have that.  This ensures that violent criminals are able to defend themselves against police brutality, and that we even the playing-field. 

- [Democrat Socialist want to ban employers from inquiring public information about their job applicants](https://imgur.com/pEUyMEv)

This means we will have thieves handling your money, and sex offenders supervising your children.  Feel *uncomfortable*?  Well that is because YOU are the problem.  You are not *opening up your mind* to *change*.  This is for the best.  Do not ask questions, bigot!

[Democrat Socialists want to strip the guns away from law abiding gun owners for misdemeanors](https://imgur.com/h2M1dTd)

[SOURCE](https://abdulformichigan.com/issues)

Ah yes.  We are just fighting 'domestic violence'  by banning firearms from people who have been charged with misdemeanors as trivial as a loud argument.  This law is going to strip the guns out of the hands of law abiding Americans, and in turn will combat gang violence and urban violence because....  Well because it just will, that's all.  Again, no questions!

------------------------------------------------------

**THERE IS MORE TO COME!**

I am not done dissecting their agenda.  These is just one of the many posts I will be making on these monsters.  They have successfully taken control of the Democrat Party, and are coming to a city near you.  They hate free speech, they hate the second amendment, they hate the White Male, they hate the family, they hate the church, they hate the flag, they hate the police, they hate the military.  

I have not even begun to expose who these people are!  Next time I am going to go through statements where they espouse things like complete open borders and legislation against harmful words.  Straight out of an Orwell novel, we will be forced to speak Newspeak if they get control of our country.  They openly oppose our Bill of Rights, and will not stop until it is destroyed, unless they are stopped first.

**CONFRONT,  ARGUE, EXPOSE**

Thank you for reading. The Dangerous and Reticent Agenda of the Democrat Socialists.
bornfree1688 https://i.redd.it/vxqcjlgouvc11.png It’s pretty astonishing that half of this sub is liberals who don’t believe us and think we’re conservative LARPs or Russian trolls. They just can’t believe anyone in their right mind would go from Bernie to Trump. Here’s my attempt at explaining how it’s possible, and why people refuse to believe i
Rand_Omname Be honest.

I walked away in 2014 or 2015 when I saw how absolutely insane, discriminatory, and tribalist the left was getting. I suspect many others here have a similar experience as mine. What I'm interested in is hearing from people who walked away more recently, especially within the past year or so. These are the people who I think this sub should be catering to, not people who already walked away years ago and are solid in their beliefs. Posters on this sub: when did you #walkaway?
bornfree1688 This isn’t about a change of opinions, it’s about waking up and realizing you’re being lied to and manipulated. There is a world of difference between what Democrats and liberal politicians say they do/stand for and what they’re *actually* doing. Dave Rubin did a great video about it that was posted on here recently [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiVQ8vrGA\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiVQ8vrGA_8). Essentially, the left is no longer liberal, they've embraced authoritarian progressivism. 

But it’s not just the crime, it’s the cover up. They are skilled operators and have done an expert job deceiving us. Half the country is still convinced that the fate of humanity and the planet depends on liberal/leftist politicians defeating the evil conservatives. The reason it’s so hard for liberals to believe we’re walking away in 2018 is that it’s so hard to convince people that so much of what they believe is simply false. It’s extra difficult to convince them when they think that the 90% negative coverage of Trump reflects reality and the only thing his supporters like about him is either fake news, alternative facts, or attributable to intolerance. 

For example, compare the media coverage of Obama’s presidency vs. Trump’s presidency. Is it not odd that the mainstream media hasn’t been very critical or did much investigating of Obama’s major scandals? When it came to Fast and Furious, the secret payments to Iran, the media seemed to always take the administration’s word on things and were quick to exonerate him instead of seeing where the facts led. Check out this Ted talk by Sheryl Attkison, a real journalist who has been alienated in her field for investigating “right wing conspiracies,” like Fast and Furious and the administration’s narrative on Benghazi [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQcCIzjz9\_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQcCIzjz9_s). 

Everyone wants to believe that Obama was the Obama of his speeches, a competent leader we could trust to guide the ship. Well the media had a big job in crafting this image for him, but it’s almost entirely a façade. He is not who you think he is. You probably have an idea who Hillary is unless you’re totally drinking the kool-aid. I’m not saying Trump is always totally honest, but keep in mind the public just recently decided to start holding the president accountable. Why were we so credulous when Obama fed us alternative facts? Because according to the media Obama was normal, and Trump is not.

If you ever wonder why the media tends to coalesce around the same narrative, look into their coordination with organizations like Media Matters, Shareblue, and Talking Points Memo, and you’ll see how much of the news is spun in someone’s favor. Or that you’re only seeing an article because somebody ordered a smear campaign. Obviously this is true of Fox too, but Fox’s real reporting that differs from CNN/MSNBC/NPR is automatically dismissed as right wing propaganda. Why assume CNN is any different? This is why alternative media has become so important. Democrats also contract fact checking sites like snopes and politifact…conflict of interest? They’re also masters of SEO and know how to get their “fair and objective” ruling at the top of google search results.  We can’t keep acting like mainstream news is the only thing we can trust. Do you really believe the media is committed to telling the truth when their interests are challenged? See what famous lefty Noam Chomsky says about it in “Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies.” 

https://i.redd.it/le8izw9idzc11.png

There is no telling how deep the corruption and lies go. It’s not just Government and the news media either, it’s Hollywood, Universities, Silicon Valley, etc. telling us what the good and proper things to say and think are. It’s frightening once you know how much EU/china-fication has come to the USA under the guise of progressivism. This is why I said walking away is about waking up, you realize how much of what you’ve been told is a lie.

And yet all we hear about is Russia. Has anyone heard that a week ago the release of FISA documents confirms the suspicion that the entire rationale of the investigative was the discredited Steele dossier which was paid for by the Democrats (and the FBI knew the Dems paid for it)? This is from NYT, not just Fox and conservative alternative media sites anymore. However Charlie Savage tells us that the indictments prove the investigation is legitimate [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/us/politics/carter-page-fisa.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/us/politics/carter-page-fisa.html). Any informed person knows that these indictments have absolutely nothing to with Trump and everything to do with making the investigation appear legitimate. Mueller probably has no intention of bringing those Russians to trial. Also, hackers and trolls are in no way evidence of collusion with Trump. Countries have an interest in other country’s election outcomes and have a favored candidate. Countries also meddle in other countries elections all the time. If a duly elected president was impeached because of this, then every president has been guilty. 

Some more things you’re not supposed to know:

•	Do you think Trump’s decisions to rescind Obama’s environmental regulations issued by Executive Order and to renege on the Paris Agreement are an existential threat to life on Earth? Don’t lose too much sleep over it, the collective effect of Obama’s climate accomplishments would have an estimated effect on global temperature of 0.23˚F by the end of the CENTURY. Was it worth killing the coal industry and countless jobs? Why does anyone think government regulation can impact global temperature? 

•	Does this indicate Trump is gearing up to drain the swamp? Time will tell. [https://www.theepochtimes.com/president-trump-declares-national-emergency-over-global-rights-abuses-and-corruption\_2393803.html](https://www.theepochtimes.com/president-trump-declares-national-emergency-over-global-rights-abuses-and-corruption_2393803.html)

•	We all know how the media alerted us to Trump’s policy of separating families caught crossing the border and all the outrage and Nazi comparisons it invoked (even though family separation was also an Obama policy). They let us know how much they care about the children, but they are strangely silent on the global human trafficking problem (a $150 billion industry). The border plays a major role in this because of the amount of illegal activity made possible by trafficking across the border, and this is one of the reasons Trump is adamant about securing the border. Why the strange selectivity in what they’re outraged about?

We’re walking away. Why is anyone surprised? It seems like half of this sub is liberals who don’t believe us and think we’re conservative LARPs or Russian trolls. They just can’t believe anyone in their right mind would go from Bernie to Trump. Here’s my attempt at explaining how it’s possible, and why people refuse to believe it
MintyEnigma Hello! I'd love to have a discussion about the blatant bias in media to the left/liberal/Democrat audience and the effect it has.

I'm a 21/F who last November discovered my conservative values, and now call myself a Conservative Libertarian. My family is all lifelong Dems. I'm still in college at an extremely liberal school on the West Coast. I'm realizing that part of what kept me liberal for so long was pop culture and social media. Maybe if late night talk shows had on conservative guests, SNL poked fun at the far-left, or big celebrities weren't socially exiled for being conservative/Republican, I would have crossed the isle sooner.

I didn't even know how much Hollywood keeps the audience in a liberal bubble of group think! It is almost concerning how much the entertainment industry rejects outside thought, opinon, debate, or civil discussion. I never got a chance to see a full, fleshed out argument by a conservative speaker until I searched for the info myself on YouTube. When someone from the right was on TV or in a movie, it had to end in the conservative looking mean and stupid, with an audience laughing when they're told to. This kept me thinking, "of course I'm Democrat- Republicans are evil, stupid, hicks! Who is crazy enough to be in their party?" Very bad, I know, but I'm sure you all understand.

Here are some recent examples of media:

[Bill Maher and Ben Shapiro debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGcdPakoytg)

[Jimmy Kimmel DACA and DEAMer Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QY5pLQqIYM)

[Meryl Streep 2017 Golden Globes Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2WYTjO5aWU)

[SNL Voters for Trump Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg0pO9VG1J8) (and basically every SNL skit, lets be real)

[Taylor Swift not going to Women's March controversy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/01/23/why-is-taylor-swifts-tweet-about-the-womens-march-so-controversial/?utm_term=.e81d5b3525d0)

[Late Night Hosts Get Real on Guns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX0ha24VmLg)

Sidenote: I know that the media is like this because many, many, people in entertainment/Hollywood are liberals for a slew of reasons and they're the ones controlling things and making the content. What I want to talk about is how it has effected you, the way you think about politics, and what you think it will do in the future if it continues.

What do all of you think of these examples? Now having walked away, do you see things like this in a different light? How do you feel about voicing your views on social media? 

Thank you for reading! I have a lot more to say, but I wanted to keep this short! Seeing the Huge Liberal Bias in Media
RisingNaledi In other words, did your beliefs on important policy issues dealing with things like universal healthcare, same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization, welfare, foreign affairs, war, prison reform, embryonic stem cell research, college education, environmental protection, equal opportunity in employment, gun control, labor unions, immigration, abortion, the death penalty, climate change, and so on and so forth change in tandem with your shift in political identification?

And where did you walk away to? The Republican Party? The Libertarian Party? The VHEMT? Did you walk away from the Democratic Party gradually or abruptly, and was this change in political identity commensurate with a change in your beliefs regarding important policy issues?
Itaintall So you’ve seen the unseemly. You’ve identified the untruths; you’ve walked away from the Democrat Party. Congratulations on beginning your journey. Knowing what to escape is half of the battle— but only half! What will you walk “to”? If you’re not diligent to codify your moral compass, your ideology, your core beliefs around what’s real, you’re susceptible to fall for the next ruse. For me, my faith in Christ is the bedrock belief that supports all others: the sanctity of human life; the importance of individual responsibility; the dignity of hard work; the respect of governing authorities; the need for individual charity; etc. etc. For me, constitutional conservatism, spiced with a bit of libertarian thought, AKA Rand Paul-ish politics is usually aligned with those values. You may arrive at a different conclusion.

Here’s my challenge to you. Think it through. Identify your core values. Write them down. Now, identify what political policy positions each of those imply. Write those down. Revisit you lists occasionally and revise as needed. Vote appropriately. 

Now, here’s the hard part. Strike a balance between dogmatism and open-mindedness. Don’t be so locked into your positions that you won’t consider re-evaluating them. Conversely, don’t be so adrift that you’ll accept any argument. This is an art. You will not master it for a very long time. Make it a life goal to calibrate that balance.

You may end-up at a different destination than I did (although I hope not), but if every citizen took this approach, we would all be more civil, and collectively more reasoned in our discourse. Peace to you and God bless. Walk to

EP13 I used to not care at all about politics, I considered myself at the most a Libertarian, economically conservative while in social policy more liberal. Now I can't really support the left, they seem far to vitriolic and hate-filled, while people on the conservative side seem far more kind and compassionate.

WarOfTheFanboys If it wasn’t already known that /r/iAMA is run but radical left power-mods, they made it clear when they banned linking to /r/WalkAway and calling our guest, Wayne Dupree, an uncle Tom and Russian spy. Wayne has been a well-respected member of his community and an inspiration for fellow black Americans his entire life. The disrespect the left gave him when he decided to \#WalkAway is exactly the sort of hate and bigotry that continues to drive people away.

Tomorrow, we have the man who started it all: Brandon Straka. We reached out to r/iAMA to appeal the ban, but they merely called Brandon a “lying faggot” and told us to piss off back to Russia.

Well, friends, I purport that Brandon is more real of an American than any of the nerd-virgin cucklord shills that run /r/iAMA. He has stood up for his values, and no communist high-schooler is going to stop him. The cowards of /r/iAMA **hate** Brandon Straka. They hate him because he exemplifies that which they are most afraid of: Introspection. You see, Brandon stopped one day and evaluated himself and his beliefs. He considered all that the left was doing and decided he couldn’t support them any longer. *Brandon realized he was on the wrong side of history, but he had the courage to admit it.*

The lowlife loser leftists of /r/iAMA will never have a moment of introspection because they are repulsed by what they’ll find. They are too scared of seeing themselves as the societal failures they’ve become. They’ve petrified of admitting they hate the country and root for its demise on a daily basis. They cower at the sight of their own misshapen bodies, spilling out from their clothes in unwashed folds and leaving behind oily smudges on cheap, imitation leather furniture.

/r/WalkAway is bringing you real people. Real stories. Real Americans. These are people who have found themselves, like Brandon, on the wrong side of history, but now live in accordance to their own values, not those of the DNC. It’s /r/iAMA that is fake. Everything that appears on their sub is corrupt by association, filtered by hateful children for their own political agendas. Their loss.

See you tomorrow night. TOMORROW AT 8PM: BRANDON STRAKA, THE AMA THAT /r/iAMA DOESN’T WANT YOU TO SEE
Ridewithme38 There is a lot that defines if someone is left or right wing. But, for most lefties they are mainly the social movements. Democrats are pro-choice, pro-gay marriage, pro-living wage, pro-universal health care and pro-marijuana legalization, etc., etc., etc.. You arent going to find a Republican candidate that supports those, not even some of those of those. 

This is why the walk away movement is so hard for so many to believe.  There are a lot of hardcore beliefs you would have to completely change.  What made you becomes anti- to all of those things? What caused you to complete abandon your core beliefs and change sides?

mrsmdavis I was born to an African-American father and White Canadian mother. My parents were textbook hippies in the 70s. I was raised in Canada after they divorced. I dealt with a lot of racism and abuse and made the decision to emigrate to the United States at 18, where I've been ever since. Even though my experience with racism as a Canadian soured me on the country, I was a committed socialist, like many Canadians. You're kind of raised with it. I also had a disdain for Americans - you're kind of raised with that too. But I came to the U.S. for a better life, despite my negative attitude toward Americans. Like most black people I was simply a default Democrat. I didn't know any Republicans or conservatives who looked like me...and why would I? They're all racists. I'd grown up hearing that Republicans wanted to bring back slavery and conservatives hated women, blacks and SEX! I believed the rich were fleecing the poor and I had a deep resentment towards my privileged white peers. I felt very strongly that most of America's problems were the result of racism and an unequal distribution of wealth. Despite my socialist beliefs, I actually worked hard to put myself through school and earn enough money to move around the country having different experiences. When I married my husband I moved into his home in Gary, IN. Before that time I'd lived in the "ghetto" but never was really a part of the culture. I could leave when I wanted, move on to other things when I wanted, etc. etc. I guess you could say I was "privileged". But in Gary, I suddenly became a PART of the neighborhood and I quickly set about putting down roots. My husband's father was a local and well-respected pastor. Together we opened an after-school program for inner city youth. Gary is about 87% black, so our hearts were directed to serve our population in the education arena. My FIL was the first black man I'd ever met who proudly called himself a "conservative" and a Republican. I was perplexed. We would often argue about things like socialism vs. capitalism, racism and inequality. He gently but intelligently challenged my notions of economics and prosperity. At the same time, here I was working every day with kids from an underprivileged, underserved population and watching how their struggles were so different day-to-day than kids in other areas. And I got to see how all the policies I supported my entire life actually worked and I realized...they didn't. I started to realize that maybe my thinking on what "help" really is might be more based in theory than real-world experience. One day I was having a conversation with a group of 5th graders about saving for their future and I realized - how can I sit here and out of one side of my mouth tell them the White American "MAN" will always keep them down and the odds are stacked against them and they'll alway be victims while out of the other side of my mouth trying to inspire them to reach for the stars and telling them they can be whatever they want and they don't have to feel trapped in their circumstances. That was the moment I decided to #WalkAway. I knew the rhetoric I'd been absorbing and regurgitating all these years wasn't just ill-informed, it was dangerous. It was keeping good people from recognizing that their less-than-ideal circumstances could actually be a springboard to hard work and success. That was a little over a decade ago. I don't like to call myself a Republican, but I'm conservative and I truly believe that America doesn't necessarily OWE us opportunity, America IS the opportunity. We don't all start off on equal footing, but just being born here puts us 5 steps ahead of everyone else in the world. I feel strongly that is a message of empowerment for black Americans and I want to see my community thrive using the values and principles of free enterprise and God-given rights. I'm a Black Woman and I Decided to #WalkAway From the Democrat Party After Running an After School Program in the Inner City...Ask Me Anything
TurnerK28 *This is not a story of me becoming a Democrat, it’s me not really identifying as a Republican anymore.*


Over my life, I have grown up seeing nothing but red and throughout my political interest I have identified as a Republican. But over the last couple of years with trump coming to the forefront of the party, I have been disenfranchised by people calling me a RINO or a “cuck” because I don’t blindly support trump. I have my beliefs; a Christian constitutional conservative and there are sometimes where trump needs to be scrutinized in my opinion but his supporters all think it’s some sort of 4D chess. 

His supporters are starting to become SJW like to people who don’t believe what they do and it’s pushing me more away from the mainstream Republican Party. I am hopeful that over time that he party will start to open back up to people who judge politicians based on their beliefs but right now that’s not the case. 

 Walk Away from the other side
DKephart This past Presidential election stunned me in more ways than one. First off, I didn't give much chance for Trump in the beginning of the primaries. Secondly, I simply couldn't see how Sanders could loose the Democratic primary. How wrong was I on both? Very, it seems! Lastly, On the night of the election, I knew one side or the other would be down and saddened. What I never expected is the continued and extreme hatred of all things Trump. It's like the entire Democratic party blew a gasket and never had it repaired. I simply don't understand why and I was wondering if any here could explain it.  Help understanding!
-life_starts_now- I was a registered democrat until a few months ago, I guess they still have my number...

With every question they asked, I could tell the surveyor was getting more and more aggravated with me. 

It was questions like:

&gt;"Do you think that the Democratic Party represents the common man?"

I said "hell no", but  I wish I said "Did you just assume my gender?"

&gt;"What do you think of Trump's Tax Plan"

I love it.


&gt;"What do you think of Trump's support for the NRA?"

Its awesome that he cares about self defense rights for us.. We can't all afford   bodyguards like Hillary. 

&gt;" Sigh...Who do you plan on voting for in the 2020 election". 

Trump. Hands down. I've walked away from the democratic party after voting for Obama twice and voting democrat for my entire life.

Every question she was getting more and more agitated with me and by the end she was sighing at the end of each question. I had to stop myself from laughing! Got a survey call from my state's democratic party....

Patoarch12 After watching "Death of a Nation" last night I can understand why the "Left"/ Democrats are trying really hard to prevent people from seeing it. The film exposes and explains the truth behind how the Democrat party evolved from the party of slavery, Jim Crow, and the KKK fighting against Republicans to keep people under their control on crop plantations to their modern version where they cause civil unrest fighting Republicans to expand government control to keep people in broken down poverty stricken welfare plantations dependent on them. If they can keep people ignorant, poor and dependent on them to eat they stay in power and control. That's also how how socialist's, dictators and communists assert control over people. Isn't it interesting that the Democrats are the party promoting "Socialism"?

I am a mixed race former Democrat who totally fell for "The Big Lie" until after Obama's first term. I began waking up when I started noticing Obama wasn't keeping his promises on making things better (increased violence, anti-police rhetoric, worse racial relations, increased poverty, increased foreign threats) so I began questioning / researching what the Democrats were really about instead of just taking other Democrats and the main stream medias word for it. CNN,MSNBC,NBC,ABC, Politico, WAPO, New York Times and many more are all very biased towards the Democrats. To test it, I would watch unedited Trump rally's/speeches from start to finish myself then compare how they interpret what Trump says vs. what he actually says. They doctor up and edit pieces of his speeches then create a false narrative to make him look like bad person. It is so dishonest.

Death of A Nation provides solid answers to these questions that most Democrats can't answer well themselves:

1. If Democrats are for helping the "Poor and Middle Class" and Republican's are only for the top "1%", why is that city's like Chicago, Detroit and others dominated by Democrat politicians for 60+ years continue to have the worst crime, poverty, schools and quality of life? Why haven't the Democrats actually done anything to improve any of these things? 

2. When Lindon B. Johnson (A Democrat President) famously said " I will have those N\*\*\*ers voting Democrat for 200 years", what was the Democrat party strategy for pulling that off and how did they succeed getting so much of the black community back onto the Democrat plantations? 

3. Why aren't the Democrats honest about the the founding of Planned Parenthood? Their founder Margaret Sanger is on record as a racist who leveraged Planned Parenthood to kill black babies in an effort to reduce the black population under the guise of "compassionate women's healthcare". Why are so many Planned Parenthood facilities located in and targeting abortions in minority neighborhoods? 

4. Why do Democrats use over the top rhetoric comparing Republicans / conservatives to Nazi's and fascists when their written party "progressive" platform aligns so closely to Hitler's Nazi party platform (i.e. disarming citizens, state run healthcare, state controlled economy etc.)? Why does the Left have organizations like "ANTIFA" causing violence and chaos attacking anyone who disagrees with them similar to Hitler and Mousolini's fascists bully gangs? 

5. Democrats often call out "alt right" racist extremists and imply that they represent the Republican party. Who are the "alt right" really? What do they believe? Are their beliefs really in line with Trump or the Republican party? D'Souza actually confronts a prominent "alt right" leader in the film and addresses their beliefs. It is interesting how much that group disagrees with Trump and align with their own brand of big government / socialist / state control of people's lives and fortunately they are nowhere near as big as the mainstream media makes them out to be. 

Anyway, do not left the Left succeed in preventing you from seeing this movie or casting pre-judgements about it. Go out and see it yourself and make your own objective judgements about it. A #Walkaway Person's Take a on D'Souza's "Death of a Nation" Movie
ChakanGenesis Have you ever seen a child fixated on exactly one thing?

For a very small child, it might be a color, such as orange. He might want to wear orange clothing, drink orange juice, even turn his hair orange if you let him. It's synesthesic, stimulus-response; something about this basic thing makes him feel happy, so he'll keep doing it. Usually, he grows out of it (or at least being so open about it).

For a somewhat older child, it might be a subject, such as dinosaurs, Harry Potter, or Fortnite. It's the thing that makes him happy. His parents might think he's addicted, and they really won't be wrong, because it's the same stimulus-response dopamine hit.

Sex becomes a factor with puberty, and drug addiction is a real problem. When most people think "addiction", they think alcohol, opiates, tobacco, methamphetamine. People versed in the subject know that gambling addiction and video game addiction are also real.

What people don't always realize is that political outrage can also be addictive.

People can easily make themselves believe pure absurdities, fixate themselves on utter nonsense, even **devote nearly every waking hour** (and even their dreams) to being politically outraged. Like a drug, every bit of outrage hits the button. They feel the pleasant stimulus response of being outraged, they act in some way (posting something online, usually), they get validation from their peers. Stimulus-response. If you don't think that people get addicted to this stuff, read their Twitter feeds and post histories.

Trump knows this. The man can literally fumble his phone ("covfefe") and instantly cause millions of his political opponents to start screaming about it. He tweets, they scream, repeat. He's almost certainly literally on the toilet as he does it (and almost certainly gleaning amusement from that fact). The man is an incorrigible, inveterate troll, and he has absolutely no reason to stop; his supporters love him for it (it's what got him elected!) and it drives his opponents to apoplexy. This cannot be said enough: The President wants the political left to be outraged. It galvanizes his supporters and makes fence-sitting conservatives and neocons outraged at the left's outrageous acts that they committed as the result of said outrage. I personally believe that he's trying to simply exhaust his opponents (and perhaps lead them to #WalkAway when they can't keep going anymore); when he can take ten seconds to make tens of thousands of people engage in ten straight hours of outrage, it's a fairly sound strategy.

Similarly, the clickbait/watchbait producers know this. Why bother trying to explain intricate political issues to the public when you can get twenty times the ad revenue by hiring perpetually outraged writers to give their outraged audience what it craves? The DNC also knows it and intends to ride a wave of outrage into 2018, and we'll see the success of that strategy in a few months. They can throw away/give away whatever public assets to whatever donors and friendly causes they like; nobody in the outrage club is going to care. All they have to be is Not Trump. Why make concessions to the traditionally anti-war section of the party when you can turn "anti-war" into "pro-Russia"?

Colleges have become host to outrage farms. Comments sections, basically the entirety of Twitter, and, yes, Reddit itself have all been turned into perpetual outrage factories. Nefarious imageboards have always thrived on outrage, and they will continue to do so.

Under this framework, nobody even needs to worry about policy anymore, because the outrage has **nothing to do with policy at all**. It's on a more fundamental level than that. This is why people say "facts don't matter" - because they don't, not while psychological issues are at play.

(This post is basically guaranteed to get replies about policy X from people who don't really understand policy X and didn't really care about policy X until they were informed that policy X was the outrage du jour.)

So, where does #WalkAway come into all this? It's not about "flipping your political outlook" as the various trolls here would have you believe, because political outlook never really had much to do with the outrage machine in the first place.

It's when the preschooler decides he doesn't want to be the orange kid anymore. It's when the gaming kid gets bored of Battle Royale. It's when the junkie staggers into rehab. It's when the prolific poster goes "I don't really care about my karma score that much, and this issue isn't going to affect me. I'm going outside."

Ultimately, it's about "Wait a minute. I'm not **doing** this anymore. I have exactly one life. I'm not going to waste it on being perpetually outraged, regardless of how many former friends want to pull me back in. I actually want to help people. I'm getting out of gender studies and going into nursing. I'm not going to be some diversity apparatchik, I'm going to be a financial advisor for low-income families. I'm done with queer theory; the world needs more engineers. And I'm really, really not donating money to people who frankly don't care about me and only pretend to care about anyone else; if I'm going to donate money, it's going to be to my favorite Kickstarter or some apolitical charity involving rejuvenation biotechnology or infectious disease eradication. I'm voting for whatever political candidate I think is better for the long-term health of the nation where I live."

Ultimately, #WalkAway is very, very similar to getting out of a cult. The Psychology of #WalkAway

Juice_Campbell I...don't know what to say! I'd like to thank the academy for this great honor. I'd like to think my friends and family for believing in me, and my lord and savior Jesus Christ!

Last but not least I'd like to think the God-Fearing Republicans, because without them this wouldn't be possible. Thank you Donald Trump, for completely switching your platforms and beliefs, being a total hypocrite, for switching up your words, to appeal to the most ignorant people in America. This wouldn't be possible without you! I got a very special leftist shill tag!

Bob_in_Mesa Walkaway campaign:

Brandon, strength is measured in so many ways, the way you’ve shown it, is one of the most admirable I’ve seen in a long time. Few realize how hard it is to speak out against the status quo, your community in New York must be livid, how you could be shunned not only by your friends and colleagues but also by those closest to you in family. 

You may ask why a Canadian is so interested in the walkway moment in the US, it is because I lived and worked in the US for 10 years, made a life there, bought a home there, raised my kids there,  though they were born in Canada, both my boys call the Arizona desert home. Now in my late 50’s my childhood experiences shaped who I am, so I understand how my kids (now men) can see it as home. Both my wife and I genuinely miss Arizona and the friendships forged.  The 2008 crisis hit the southwest hard.

Brandon, I don’t know if the fear of losing it all is the same fear you had before you demonstrated your incredible strength, by doing what you’ve done and in hindsight what you’ve accomplished. My plight in 2008-2009 was the so scary for me, I had no employer to petition the US government for the renewal of my work visa and being what I am, there was no way I could find a way to legally get a green card. I exhausted most of our money and recourses to finding a way to legal immigration.

Walkway from my home, my debts, my friends, starting all over again was indeed one of the most terrifying things I’ve ever went through. 

Brandon, until you came along I was losing hope, not only in my personal life, but in life in general, specifically western valves, when I saw you on Judge Jennie the walkway movement was not even a thing. You have given me back HOPE for the future. A lot of people believe the western world has past the point of no return with respect to our culture. 

It is hard for me to believe that because I obeyed the immigration laws of the U.S. It was the right thing to do. I see the R.C.P.M. (Canadian federal police) reduced to baggage handlers at the U.S. and Canadian border helping people break our immigration laws and our government using hard earned tax dollars to make them as comfortable as possible. 

I had 2 illegal avenues open to me in Arizona which would have saved my home and my accumulated wealth, but would have lost something far more valuable, my sense of right and wrong, and my integrity. I hope and pray I’ve past those valves to my children, it cost me dearly. I see the left’s hatred of Mr. Trump as something almost demonic. I’ve been a supporter of his since he announced he was running for president, I was laughed at and ridiculed. 

Brandon, this is when I realized the western valves I believed in, my sense of right and wrong, were in so much trouble in this country, my Canada. It came to a head in my office when I was seated next to a Middle Eastern man who truly hated the western way of life. But he lived the life, with a sports car and a newer motorcycle, several trips to the Middle East per year. I offend wondered as he spewed his hated of western culture, his rhetoric about Israel and Donald Trump why he was even here. Mr. Trumps name would often come into our arguments and the one thing he hated was the ban on muslum countries. I understood because I lived in the States during 9-11. The one solidifying comment he made during one of those arguments to make me realize Trump was so correct was when he answered my question of what was the end game with respect to Israel.   His answer will always haunt me; his reply was “EXTERMINATION OF THE WHITE PEOPLE”. One other person heard this comment, I was so upset by this comment it was beyond words, I could not understand why the other person with 3 little white babies was not as equally as shocked. It was around the same time a man named Jessie Williams came out with his racist rant at the 2016 BET awards. This person told me he could not see any racist comments in his speech, I said  just take out every reference to whiteness and inject any other term relating to an identifiable group and wait and see what sort of blow back it would receive. He could not see it, this is when I knew he was a coward, and lost all my respect for him. Even if he was a good worker that did not matter to me anymore, he would sacrifice his own children, so that he would not be classed as a racist by an oblivious racist. So backward and it is how this person maintained control not only of the person in question but of the entire staff of this company. He had them all under his thumb. 

Once, when I was trying to explain what Mr. Trump was talking about when that “touch them on the p .....y” recording came out, I was trying to explain that he was talking about a kind of women, a women who would do anything just to be close to fame, I know, I roadied for a rock band in the late 70’s. Women I never would have a chance at were throwing themselves at me, just to get closer to the band members. It was shocking to me. But, because I understood what he was talking about it didn’t matter, even the most educated people I was associated with believed he was a misogynist, which of course he is not, he is just a famous man and I’m sure there are still women who would do anything just to be associated with him, that is just human nature.

Brandon, what you are doing not only may save America, but it just might wake up the western world to the danger it is in from people in the world who are not dissimilar from the attitudes and policies of the democratic party in the United States. Thank you for what you are doing.

MrDinkster [Emotional Intelligence Areas](https://i.redd.it/oir73kkdqie11.jpg)

We've been looking into the Democrats for awhile now, trying to find out exactly what's going on with them. How they can lack self-awareness and simple things like empathy.

Looking through some information on social intelligence, it seems that's exactly what they lack. It's what is causing their intense disconnect with reality.

They lack:

Self-Awareness - The inability to reflect on themselves on their actions.

Motivation - In return are pushing for things like welfare and Universal Basic Income.

Empathy - Just take a look at any story about a Trump supporter to see Democrat lack of empathy.

Social Skills - As you've seen them debate on Twitter, you've seen their severe lack of such skills.

Self-Regulation - A very big problem with Democrats, they are unable to self-regulate and thus need the government to regulate for them.

Just figured it could be a fun, lighthearted topic to take a little trip into the minds of Democrats. Democrats &amp; Emotional Intelligence
RealBrandonStraka Many former Democrats have recently been “red-pilled”. Some here have wanted to leave for some time, but have feared the consequences they might suffer from friends or family if they walk away. 

But this campaign also serves another very important purpose. For far too long, the left has controlled the narrative in this country in news and media while the “silent majority” on the right have done what they always do—remained silent. The left has been allowed for so long to reinforce the narrative that everybody on the right is a bigot, a racist, a homophobe, a misogynist, etc. But the left has become so extreme, it’s now time to fight back. I want people on the right to use their voices and tell the world the truth about who they are. Please make a video telling everyone what it means to be a conservative in America. What your values really are. Tell minorities on the left who have been told their whole lives that they are not welcome on the right because of the bigotry and hatred of the people on the right that they are welcome. That there is a seat at the table on the right for everybody. 

This is a movement of patriots of all walks of life- men, women, black, brown, white, straight, LGBT, religious, un-religious, who share something very important in common... we are Americans. And we want our country back.  Hi everyone, I’m Brandon Straka, founder of #WalkAway Campaign, a true grassroots movement, dedicated to sharing the stories of people who can no longer accept the current ideology of liberalism and what the Democrat Party has become.

Nervouskukk0101101 Haha how sad is it that you cant even host an ama without locking the comments? Maybe think twice about using "snowflakes" in the future. Hi R/walkaway! So inspiring.
EP13 Hypocrisy at it's finest. Accuse T_D of brigading and then go right ahead and do it yourselves. The disgusting brigading of the Brandon Straka AMA just proves my suspicions that I was right to leave the left.
siricosirus Not sure if this belongs here, I can remove it but this event has made me truly despise the propaganda and brainwashing from democratic sorts.

 White guy from EU here and this involves a friend of mine who is a white woman in the same country. 

So this is a good friend of mine, we have been friends for like 6months, nothing romantic.

Yesterday we are talking on the phone and she's complaining how it's boiling hot and she hates jeans (it's like mid 90sF or so) I asked why she is wearing jeans in this weather and she said "down the road are a bunch of refugees so if I wear shorts skirts etc then it might agitate them but it's not their fault"

I was gob smacked, absolutely gob smacked.

I lost a job before because a Muslim woman was being beaten and cheated on by her husband, she talked to me about it and I told her she needs to get out. Our boss who is also a Muslim caught wind of this so constructed dismissal against me because, in his words, I am not one of them. I was racially and religiously discriminated against. (I'm in a much better position now) 

My friend knows this and chose this time to bring it back up and say that that also wasn't their fault. It was mine!? She continued to say that I cant have been a victim of racism because I have privilege (Im not a holocaust victim and so I am privileged) and you can't be racist to white people because we have superiority. (!?!?!?)

I tried explaining to her I a calm way but she reverted to sarcasm and snark. There isn't anything to be done here but I felt like venting about it. A friend of mine released just how messed up she is and it's very disheartening.

I want to add that though I have had issues with Muslim groups I have quite a few Muslim friends, I am aware its not all of them just certain groups.

Sorry for the rant / ramble Rant about friend
EP13 I understand that it can be frustrating to talk with Democrats here, especially because they tend to  Removing Liberal Posts
Silver8592 How do I tell my family and friends (who is 100% of the Democratic Party) that I am a Republican? Also, when do you think is the most appropriate time? When I become of  voting age or now? Thank you for your help. I am asking this because I am fully aware of all the conservatives who have been ostracized and feel left out after they have told their relatives that they are conservative.   Question For #WalkAway Members
dd525 so I am going to be a transfer junior in two weeks from my local community college to my local university,and i plan on majoring in English. now i am not conservative or liberal, I am more of an independent. however, I have heard it is hard  to be a conservative college student and i want to know if that is true? i am a black gay man and people expect me to be a certain way or think a certain way. The #walkaway movement has really opened my eyes to try and have conversations like this. so if anyone is a college student,please lets have the conversation. Being a conservative college student
TheRealMarkB I votes for Hillary in 2016. In 2020 I'm voting for Trump. Trump has shown to put Americans first and although at first I didn't like him I saw all the hate the leftists were sending at him and that made me support him and the GOP. He has to put up with this hate. Another reason why I #walkedaway was because of the horrible actions of Antifa protesters. It saddend me to see the part I used to associate with turn into a fascist communist pile of dirt.  I used to be a democrat
The-Plauge-Dragon Who here is going to or has seen Death of a Nation?  I haven’t yet but from what I’ve heard it is a giant redpill in movie format.  The best reasons to walk away are easy to find. Just read history.
FreeBee13 \[removed\] How do you treat “Trump Derangement Syndrome”?
RussianBot4Trump When the fall semester starts, everyone should chalk their college campus sidewalks with #WalkAway! This would be AMAZING to see! It would also help spread the Walk Away movement despite the social media censorship that is happening.

Mods, can you make another post and sticky it? I don't want any credit, I just want to see it happen!

PitoStinko Are you willing to to personally care for any within your own home or properties you own?   If so, then show us how caring you are because I can refer you to a website coordinates exactly this.  We all know that talk is cheap, and virtue signalling only goes so far, so here is your chance to prove us all wrong!  

If you are not willing to take in any illegals, why not?

Is it because you hate Hispanics?

Is it because you are a racist?

Is it because you are a xenophobe? Open question to the liberals who call us racist for wanting a secure border.
jeff_the_old_banana The unite the right are mostly pretty much scum agitators who do not represent Trump's base. A lot of them are probably plants  and agitators too.  Don't fall for the trap of thinking these are legitimate trump supporters.

The leader of the movement was an outspoken Democrat and leader during the occupy wall street rally.  Some say he has connections with the FBI (FOI requests over the years show the FBI have a very long history of organizing these sorts of events). That Nazi Richard Spencer who was interviewed saying he  thinks socialism would be good for America (like all good Nazis) is attending. Also Gavin McGuiness and the proud boys refused to attend because they also think it is a fake rally full of agitators.

There will be trouble there caused for the benefit of the media to make Trump look bad. Expect to see a few brand new Nazi flags with creases because they were just removed from the packaging. These Unite the Right rally's are a trap. Don't fall for it.
mrsmdavis I was born to an African-American father and White Canadian mother. My parents were textbook hippies in the 70s. I was raised in Canada after they divorced. I dealt with a lot of racism and abuse and made the decision to emigrate to the United States at 18, where I've been ever since. Even though my experience with racism as a Canadian soured me on the country, I was a committed socialist, like many Canadians. You're kind of raised with it. I also had a disdain for Americans - you're kind of raised with that too. But I came to the U.S. for a better life, despite my negative attitude toward Americans. Like most black people I was simply a default Democrat. I didn't know any Republicans or conservatives who looked like me...and why would I? They're all racists. I'd grown up hearing that Republicans wanted to bring back slavery and conservatives hated women, blacks and SEX! I believed the rich were fleecing the poor and I had a deep resentment towards my privileged white peers. I felt very strongly that most of America's problems were the result of racism and an unequal distribution of wealth. Despite my socialist beliefs, I actually worked hard to put myself through school and earn enough money to move around the country having different experiences. When I married my husband I moved into his home in Gary, IN. Before that time I'd lived in the "ghetto" but never was really a part of the culture. I could leave when I wanted, move on to other things when I wanted, etc. etc. I guess you could say I was "privileged". But in Gary, I suddenly became a PART of the neighborhood and I quickly set about putting down roots. My husband's father was a local and well-respected pastor. Together we opened an after-school program for inner city youth. Gary is about 87% black, so our hearts were directed to serve our population in the education arena. My FIL was the first black man I'd ever met who proudly called himself a "conservative" and a Republican. I was perplexed. We would often argue about things like socialism vs. capitalism, racism and inequality. He gently but intelligently challenged my notions of economics and prosperity. At the same time, here I was working every day with kids from an underprivileged, underserved population and watching how their struggles were so different day-to-day than kids in other areas. And I got to see how all the policies I supported my entire life actually worked and I realized...they didn't. I started to realize that maybe my thinking on what "help" really is might be more based in theory than real-world experience. One day I was having a conversation with a group of 5th graders about saving for their future and I realized - how can I sit here and out of one side of my mouth tell them the White American "MAN" will always keep them down and the odds are stacked against them and they'll alway be victims while out of the other side of my mouth trying to inspire them to reach for the stars and telling them they can be whatever they want and they don't have to feel trapped in their circumstances. That was the moment I decided to #WalkAway. I knew the rhetoric I'd been absorbing and regurgitating all these years wasn't just ill-informed, it was dangerous. It was keeping good people from recognizing that their less-than-ideal circumstances could actually be a springboard to hard work and success. That was a little over a decade ago. I don't like to call myself a Republican, but I'm conservative with libertarian leanings and I truly believe that America doesn't necessarily OWE us opportunity, America IS the opportunity. We don't all start off on equal footing, but just being here puts us 5 steps ahead of everyone else in the world. I feel strongly that is a message of empowerment for black Americans and I want to see my community thrive using the values and principles of free enterprise and God-given rights. I'm a Black Woman Who Decided to #WalkAway From the Democrat Party After Running an After School Program in the Inner City...Ask Me Anything
ilovekingsepron They constantly attack the president and call him racist when actually they're the ones who are racist. They think that just because I am black they deserve my vote. I voted for Obama twice and I didn't vote in 2016 but I'm certain that in 2020 I'll be voting for Trump to stop the racist democrats. AMA I am a black man who walked away from the democrats AMA
DeplorableCadet Patriots are walking away from the Democrat party because they see something isn't quite right! https://youtu.be/-GesMTNxjLI
PitoStinko This whole story is very amusing to me because it really highlights how corrupt and shortsighted the DNC can be, while at the same time accentuating how gullible liberals are.

The story begins about 2 months ago, [when the DNC promised to not accept money from fossil fuel companies](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8qmt19/dnc_votes_unanimously_to_no_longer_accept_money/).  There is a link within that reddit post, but I purposely linked you to the comments on the r/politics page to show you how malleable the left is.  As you can see, the vast majority of the comments are screaming 'Sieg Heil' while praising the DNC, while the comments that show skepticism and cynicality are downvoted with accusations of 'Russian bot' being thrown at the critics.  A story upvoted 50 thousand times, and a joyride of a comment section.  It is all there, saved in writing for you to read it.  It is the left's comments, not ours.

Well you turn the clocks closer to midterms, and then this happens...  [Opps!](https://www.ecowatch.com/dnc-fossil-fuel-donations-2595481111.html)

Now before I get into Reddit's hypocrisy on the subject, I want to dive into the DNC's move here and breakdown their reasoning for this play.  This part is my opinion, obviously, but I believe it is a fairly obvious opinion and one even liberals may agree with.  I will try my best not to drive this point home with the jeering against the left that I am known around here for.

It's pretty simple...  *The centrist vote is more important than the feelings of the far left.*

The DNC is very good at lip-service and pandering.  It is what they have used to win elections for decades now.  They know that getting votes from liberals is as easy as bait, hook, line, and sinker.  They know they do not have to follow through with any promises, and the left will turn out no matter what.  They could run Hillary again in 2020 while using the same blackout tactics they used against Bernie toward whatever progressive candidate we see at the time.  In other words, they don't have to walk the walk for the progressive vote, just talk the talk.

Whether you like it or not, oil and gas is the backbone of the American economy, and with almost 10 million jobs across the nation, o&amp;g make up almost 10% of the workforce in this country.  The DNC needs these people's money and the money of their employers.

So this tells us one of two things.

-Despite what the media is telling us, the democrats are in a panic for November, and are now struggling to recapture the centrist vote

or

-The DNC knew all along that they never intended to blacklist corporate o&amp;g money and were simply trying to entice progressives into getting out for special elections.

This isn't a conspiracy...  It is one of those two things.  The DNC really did claim it would refuse corporate o&amp;g money, and they really did welsh on this decision.  This isn't right wing fake news.  So which is it?  In my opinion, it is the former.  I think the DNC understands that no matter what they do, they will always have the liberal vote, always, and now they have to draw in the centrist vote in a booming economy.  If I am correct, you will see a strong shift towards the center in the campaign ads for democrats this coming election season.

Now on to my favorite part of the story.  The stuff that left me giddy with excitement because I knew this was coming, and I think many of us did.  [Here is the updated story on the same subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/96hzvd/dnc_now_accepting_donations_from_fossil_fuel/), kindly linked directly to the comments by yours truly.  Notice the number of upvotes and downvotes?  Notice the lack of attention the story is getting?  It's a huge story!  Where are the soapbox progressives like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Cortez on the subject?  Nowhere to be found...  Isn't that interesting? The hypocrisy of Reddit. Why the DNC reversed its stance on not accepting donations from Fossil Fuel companies and how propaganda works. A move we on the right saw coming from a mile away.
myg0dd The #1 example on r/politics right now is a prime example on how The Democratic Party thrives on extremely dumb people. All the media has to do at this point is allege things, and the retarded rampant left eats it up like Dogma. How many baseless, unproved allegations have there been? **Unproved** being the key word, as the only thing supporting anything the left whips up is simply accusations. There isn't a Tape of Trump saying the N-word anywhere, and clearly Omarosa had her own priorities of working for herself rather the American people when she took the job. Now shes publishing tapes of her and other aides discussing her accusations, none of which are ever proven, and these dumbasses on reddit are treating it like *another* smoking gun. Dont be that dumbass.  "OMAROSA HAS TAPE OF TRUMP SAYING N WORD." ... "OMAROSA RELEASES TAPE OF TRUMP AIDES DISCUSSING SOMETHING!"
ThrombBone 
 Here's what it looks like when all the pieces are sewn together. It smells like conspiracy and treason.  Everyone needs to read this. Slowly, and patiently, because it’s very important......

From 2001 to 2005 there was an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

A Grand Jury had been empanelled.

Governments from around the world had donated to the “Charity”.

Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those “Donations” to the Clinton Foundation were declared.

Hmmm, now you would think that an honest investigator would be able to figure this out.

Guess who took over this investigation in 2002?

Bet you can’t guess.

None other than James Comey.

Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?

Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS?

Your friend and mine, Lois “Be on The Look Out” (BOLO) Lerner.

Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?

It gets better, well not really, but this is all just a series of strange coincidences, right?

Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005?

No other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein.

Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?

Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this time frame?

I know, it’s a miracle, just a coincidence, just an anomaly in statistics and chances, but it was Robert Mueller.

What do all four casting characters have in common?

They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation.

Now that’s just a coincidence, right?

Ok, lets chalk the last one up to mere chance.

Let’s fast forward to 2009......

James Comey leaves the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin.

Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, on her own personal email server by the way.

The Uranium One “issue” comes to the attention of the Hillary.

Like all good public servants do, you know looking out for America’s best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to no other than, the Russians.

Now you would think that this is a fairly straight up deal, except it wasn’t, the People got absolutely nothing out of it.

However, prior to the sales approval, no other than Bill Clinton goes to Moscow, gets paid 500K for a one hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours.

Ok, no big deal right?

Well, not so fast, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme.

Guess who was the FBI Director during this time frame?

Yep, Robert Mueller.

He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009.

Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney’s Office in Maryland?

No other than, Rod Rosenstein.

Guess what happened to the informant?

The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out about it.

How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise?

Guess what happened soon after the sale was approved?

~145 million dollars in “donations” made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal.

Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division?

No other than, Lois Lerner.

Ok, that’s all just another series of coincidences, nothing to see here, right?

Let’s fast forward to 2015.

Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9 “investigations” the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi discovers that the Hillary ran the State Department on an unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server.

He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her “Public Service” as Secretary of State which was required by law.

He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email.

Sparing you the State Departments cover up, the nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we shall leave it with this…… they did everything humanly possible to cover for Hillary.

Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI Director in 2013?

Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer (Lockheed Martin) with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer?

No other than James Comey.

Amazing how all those no-bids just went right through at State, huh?

Now he is the FBI Director in charge of the “Clinton Email Investigation” after of course his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner “Matter” at the Internal Revenue Service and exonerates her.

Nope.... couldn’t find any crimes there.

Can you guess what happened next?

In April 2016, James Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy.

They didn’t even convene a Grand Jury.

Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, like the true “Gangsta” Homey is, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016, and exonerates the Hillary from any wrongdoing.

Can you see the pattern?

It goes on and on, Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues.

FISA Abuse, political espionage..... pick a crime, any crime, chances are...... this group and a few others did it.

All the same players.

All compromised and conflicted.

All working fervently to NOT go to jail themselves.

All connected in one way or another to the Clinton's.

They are like battery acid, they corrode and corrupt everything they touch.

How many lives have these two destroyed?

As of this writing, the Clinton Foundation, in its 20+ years of operation of being the largest International Charity Fraud in the history of mankind, has never been audited by the Internal Revenue Service.

Let us not forget that Comey's brother works for DLA Piper, the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation's taxes.

And,
See the person that is the common denominator to all the crimes above and still doing her evil escape legal maneuvers at the top of the 3 Letter USA Agencies?  Yep, that would be Hillary R. Clinton.


WHO IS LISA BARSOOMIAN?

Let’s learn a little about Mrs. Lisa H. Barsoomian’s background.

Lisa H. Barsoomian, a US Attorney that graduated from Georgetown Law, is a protege of James Comeyand Robert Mueller.

Barsoomian, with her boss R. Craig Lawrence, represented Bill Clinton in 1998.

Lawrence also represented:

Robert Mueller three times;

James Comey five times;

Barack Obama 45 times;

Kathleen Sebelius 56 times;

Bill Clinton 40 times; and

Hillary Clinton 17 times.

Between 1998 and 2017, Barsoomian herself represented the FBI at least five times.

You may be saying to yourself, OK, who cares? Who cares about the

work history of this Barsoomian woman?

Apparently someone does, because someone out there cares so much

that they’ve “purged” all Barsoomian court documents for her Clinton

representation in Hamburg vs. Clinton in 1998 and its appeal in 1999

from the DC District and Appeals Court dockets (?). Someone out there

cares so much that the internet has been “purged” of all information

pertaining to Barsoomian.

Historically, this indicates that the individual is a protected CIA operative.

Additionally, Lisa Barsoomian has specialized in opposing Freedom of

Information Act requests on behalf of the intelligence community.

And, although Barsoomian has been involved in hundreds of cases

representing the DC Office of the US Attorney, her email address is

Lisa Barsoomian at NIH gov. The NIH stands for National Institutes of

Health.

This is a tactic routinely used by the CIA to protect an operative by

using another government organization to shield their activities.

It’s a cover, so big deal right? I mean what does one more attorney

with ties to the US intelligence community really matter?

It deals with Trump and his recent tariffs on Chinese steel and

aluminum imports, the border wall, DACA, everything coming out of

California, the Uni-party unrelenting opposition to President Trump,

the Clapper leaks, the Comey leaks, Attorney General Jeff Sessions

recusal and subsequent 14 month nap with occasional forays into the

marijuana legalization mix …. and last but not least Mueller’s

never-ending investigation into collusion between the Trump team and

the Russians.

Why does Barsoomian, CIA operative, merit any mention?


BECAUSE….

She is Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s WIFE….That’s why!!

 More reasons to "walk away"

Deepsack Hello, I’m looking for advice, comments, questions, etc:

Recently I read in the papers that a man is suing the Federal Government for refusing to recognize that Bigfoot is real, and claims that he has the evidence and eyewitness testimony to irrefutably prove that Bigfoot should be recognized.

This gave me the idea to seek advice for a lawsuit I believe I can win.

As you know, in Canada, we have compelled speech, and the LGBTQ sex addict death cult has such high power here that they can take your brainwashed children away if you refuse to chemically lobotomize them at their whim, even if they are still adolescents.

This is all based on the FALSE PREMISE that Sexuality is genetic and that Gender is a choice - the complete INVERSE of reality.

Ex-gays and ex-trans people exist en masse and prove that these are lifestyle choices. Men turning into women is a scientific biological impossibility, not to mention completely UNOBSERVED.

A man “living as a woman”, is a man living in delusion, because they cannot possibly become women. A man’s brain is on average 10% larger than a woman’s brain. This is just one of MUTITIUDES Of unchangeable, Biological features that DEFINE gender, let alone the obvious Chromosomal and visible differences.

Over 90% of trans are male to fake female Over 65% are child molestation victims Over 45% of trans kill themselves (post/pre-op) - higher suicide rate that Holocaust prisoners, so citing “persecution” is laughable. Over 60% of gay men admit to having sex with underage boys.

LGBTQ is a sex addict death cult.

Why do crackheads smoke crack, even though they know it is bad for them? They know it will ostracize them from society, yet they still do it. Why? Because they are addicts. Same reason why sodomites engage in SEPTIC, ANATOMICALLY INCORRECT “sex” (more like sadism).

I aim to put a stop to the deception, I aim to put a stop to government funding of this religious belief that “sexuality is something you’re born with while gender isn’t”, because ex-gays and ex-trans absolutely crush this narrative.

I also aim to get rid of Justin Trudeau and impeaching him based on his inability to discern truth, or to be at all interested in things which are true that contradict his DANGEROUS lie of a world view. Dangerous to who? The minds and lives of children who believe mainstream media and don’t even know ex-gays and ex-trans exist (like most of you who were brainwashed by a Lady Gaga song and just learned they exist through this post).

Who wants to represent me in this potentially world shattering lawsuit? I am looking to sue the Canadian Federal Government for lying about the nature of Sexuality and Gender
jrodnoh [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=787HlCe1Tgk&amp;t=7s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=787HlCe1Tgk&amp;t=7s) I found a cool #WalkAway Testimony
WaterBear14 and i still am  Hello. I used to be a liberal.
Deepsack Hello everyone,

This is a very simple logical concept that the mainstream media lies to you about, and that many of you currently, or in the past, believed:

“All Acceptance” is NOT loving.
“All Acceptance” accepts DECEPTION.
Deception should be LOGICALLY hated and avoided.
The epitomized action of showing someone LOVE is to TELL THEM THE TRUTH.
Truth is INTOLERANT of deception.
Truth is INTOLERANT of emotion.
Emotion is NOT objective.
Emotion CAN deceive you.
Truth can NEVER deceive you.

The mainstream wants you to value your emotions more than the truth.  They teach you that your “emotions make you human”, when the reality is that ALL ANIMALS EXHIBIT EXTREME EMOTION CONSTANTLY.  Humans are the only ones who exhibit critical thinking and deep logical decision making.  LOGIC is what defines humanity.  Our ability to DISCERN TRUTH.

Our physical brains have a system called the Limbuc System.  In times of extreme emotional distress, our Limbic System “activates”, which bypasses our cognition and takes decisions from our SUBCONSCIOUS PROGRAMMING.  This results in “temporary insanity”, and this process is fed and matured when you value and express emotion more often than Logic.

Truth can be PERCEIVED as negative.
NEGATIVITY IS NOT AN EVIL THING.
For example: Being NEGATIVE about your health leads to working out and taking vitamins to prevent illness, while being POSITIVE makes you end up getting sick and curing your illness after the fact instead of preventing it to begin with.

Just because you are NEGATIVE about something doesn’t mean you don’t have the right to be.  I’m negative about Nazism, does that make me a bad person?  I’m negative about racism too!  I guess I should be more POSITIVE?

This Positivity vs Negativity rhetoric is so weak and childish it makes me sick to my stomach that it’s still peddled religiously by charismatic Liberal leaders as if it’s a moral concept.  It’s insane.

Liberals perceive truths that refute them, as NEGATIVE, so I guess they’re NEVER OBJECTIVELY WRONG?

The point is, STOP VALUING EMOTION ABOVE TRUTH.  Emotions are MEANINGLESS when objective TRUTH stands against it.

I saw a lot of this emotional rhetoric in my other topic exposing the gay and trans “born this way” [feel good] rhetoric by referring to ex-gays and ex-trans.  All the REAL bigots against truth and ex-gays/trans came out of the woodwork and don’t even recognize they are hypocrites.  Why?  Because they are emotionally distressed and acting un-cognitively, in efforts to dismiss the TRUTH they perceive as negative. Hello to all ex-Liberals, here is a logical concept you should learn and teach others
Platypusz7 I was a life long liberal but the last time I voted for a Democrat was for Obama's first term.  I'm against being the police of the world so when Obama continued the world police funding (Trump too), I was out.  I voted for Jill Stein just as a protest vote, twice.  I supported Bernie Sanders and when I saw how the media treated him in favor of Clinton, I moved a bit further away.  

However, everything changed  when I began to see the violence of the left.  As a huge Grateful Dead guy I'm peaceful.  I'm pro freedom and anti authoritarian. All the sudden these cores values seemed to be more in line with the right.  I couldn't believe the disrespect and violence outside Trump rallies.  I moved further away.  

As the years went by I was in shock of the anti white and general racism of the left.  I was taught to cherish the words of MLK but now his words seemed to be more in line with the right.  I moved further away.

Evergreen also opened my eyes to the outright ridiculousness of the far left.  I walked away, but now what?  How can I support a President who acts like a five year old boy who didn't get his third helping of ice cream.  This man is flat out nuts.  I have still yet to ever vote for a Republican in my life, this will change in the mid terms where I will vote R down the line.  However, how can I vote for such a man as Trump.  On pure policy I agree with him more than Dems but how can I justify his child like behavior and the damage that can cause.       DeadHead Walked Away But I Have No Home Now.
EP13 I'm not a big fan of our President currently, although he has done better for our country than I at first feared. Do I have to be a die-hard Trump supporter to still be involved or is it not that big a deal? Do you have to support Trump to be in this sub?
myg0dd What kid of sad pathetic soul actually pays for propaganda? Right now r/politics has an article with the title *1/3RD OF AMERICANS DONT SUPPORT TRUMP* or something along those lines.. Despite everyone clearly seeing [This Rasmussen poll](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/trump_administration/prez_track_aug17) that shows approval at 49% (higher than Obama's was at one point.) Anyway, I digress.. Thank your lucky stars you're not delusional enough to pay to read the Washington Post.  I always laugh to myself when r/politics links a Washington Post article that IMMEDIATELY leads to a pay-wall...
EffectiveSubject LOL You're all dumb as fuck.
zardoz68 What’s interesting is, I was a die hard Reagan fan. He was the original renegade outsider that turned politics upside down. At least in my lifetime. He did some disappointing things, but overall gave me proof that things could get so much better.

After that, I was an Independent / Libertarian / Green split voter because no one candidate checked all the issues boxes important to me. That New World Order shit really ground my gears for a long time. None of my candidates won Nationally, but at the State and Local level, I had some victories I could be happy about.

Over those years, the political shift of the Left, to further Left into Socialism, if not Actual Communism, has placed me, a Centrist, into the Right side of the Overton Window.

This last Election, I actually hoped that Cruz, would get the nod, and I could vote for him knowing he would uphold at least a majority of issues I care about.

I ended up voting for Stein, because honestly, Johnson went completely off the rails into mentally incompetent territory. And there wasn’t a worthwhile Independent that even stirred my interest. A reality TV, real estate billionaire Republican you say? Holy shit, we’re fucked.

After Stein’s little recount stunt post election, it opened my eyes to how shallow and establishment level most of my fallback candidates were. Follow the money. I was honestly impressed that Trump spent half what Hillary did and won despite the odds.

That’s when I decided to start looking into what kind of person President Trump is. I started watching his campaign speeches, watched the debates, and talked with neighbors about what they thought about him.

So, I have a lesbian couple as neighbors that I go shooting with occasionally, and they stop by for a beer once in a while, and was surprised to find that they had voted for President Trump. Totally threw me for a loop. After explaining their reasoning, I began to dig deeper.

Then it hit me, President Trump checked nearly all my special interest boxes the entire time. I felt betrayed that none of that information had been readily available for me to make an informed decision. The entire MSM was, and still is, being used as a weapon against him.

Shortly before the Inauguration I discovered The_Donald (go ahead and check doubters). I followed an rRedacted thread here to see what all the noise was about. Holy shit! Now I’ve been here shitposting ever since.

So Shills, go ahead and add me to your stupid fucking MassTagger list. I recoded it so I can tell who my friends are, and I’ve been tagging you as well. Have fun LARPing as soldiers against real Combat Vets like me and many others when your ^revolution^ comes down the road.

 My #WalkAway Journey
No-Steppe-on-Pepe You're only making things worse for your party. Seriously, it reeks of desperation. Just stop. Dear Democrat Loyalists: You are not going to stop people from leaving your party by trying to sabotage a subreddit.
SignificantMammoth 1. What are your thoughts on the alt-right?
   1. I love the alt-right!
   2. I like them.
   3. Don't really dislike, nor like them.
   4. I dislike them.
   5. I hate them.
2. What are your thoughts on anti-semitism and racism?
   1. It's 100% wrong.
   2. It's bad.
   3. No opinion/Neutral.
   4. It's okay.
   5. Fake news, it doesn't exist anymore.
3. What are your thoughts on Hitler?
   1. A horrible person!
   2. A bad person.
   3. Neutral.
   4. I agree with his views and like him.

Thanks for taking this poll! (Do so in the comments). 

JUST A NOTE:

Three of these are opinion questions, while one actually does have an answer. The answer to question 4 is #2, or #3 depending what your other was. As even though Hitler led the "Socialist Party" in Germany at the time, his views were  FASCIST, and similar to today's ALT-RIGHT! Random Poll/Test!
snowmanbg What the hell is this sub about...the retards from thedonald banned me so i'd likely get banned and from here? So are you guys pro-russian or so?
RedditPolitcalThrow I’m not a Trump supporter completely, but I am much more sympathetic to the cause than I was. I must say it feels amazing to not be a part of the hive mind. I am officially done with the tired old Democratic Party.
BaptizedNRG I used to think big government could solve all our problems. I used to think our wars were all justified. Then I realized America was capable of committing war crimes  like every other nation. I realized corporations exercised too much control over our government and over the working class. 

I thought Republicans were the party of the rich. Then I realized Democrats were in the party of big business too. The disaster of Obamacare proved we could not rely on corporations to provide quality healthcare to all citizens.

I thought Republicans were cruel to immigrants. Then I realized Obama was a huge deporter of people just seeking a better life.

All in all, I couldn't get over the hypocrisy of Democrats who gave lip service to workers and the oppressed, but were on the side of big business every time it mattered. They enabled or passively protested Trump's fascism at every turn. The only people willing to take action were the socialists. And that's why I'm a proud anarcho-communist.

Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains! You have a world to win! Why I left the Democratic Party and joined the Far Left.
WaterBear14 Seriously, what the fuck is this sub? There are almost no actual liberals walking away. This whole sub is just r/The_Donald with less subscribers. The posts saying they walked away are users like u/Patriot1776MAGA saying they used to be democrats which is totally believable. A liberal magically saying they hate the left now is just a Trump troll’s wet dream. In 2016, you divided us by separating the Bernie and Hillary supporters, but now your plan for destroying the left is telling liberals their party has gone too far left. Nobody is falling for that bullshit, and that’s why there will be a blue wave.      Bye, and I hope you enjoyed the red pill! My story of escape from the Democratic plantation

[Click here](https://markable.in/file/da2a44e6-24ea-11e7-b94e-0a41a440e2ed.html). Nearly 400 news stories and examples of why you should walk away.


 Nearly 400 reasons to walk away
dd525 So I do not see myself supporting Trump,or Pence in the near future. However, i do see why people are walking away from the left. The left has really become to toxic,and has backed itself in a corner. In the november elections I do think their is going to be a red wave because the democrats have no plans going forward. They have been spouting out the same anti trump rhetoric and they will loose. I could be wrong but I do think they will loose. Also, people are tired of not having real conversations or being dismissed as racist,or sexiest. While covering mollie Tibbets some commentatrs on CNN and MSNBC just refer to her as some girl,and it makes them look so condescending. Also no one on those networks will talk about how this guy got around so many obstacles to be there in the first place.
I started my junior year as a transfer student this week at my college, and I see how pc culture has gone to far. My professor was going over all the assignments and what to do if we were offended. He told us how this one girl reportered him to the dean last year because she read a story about adultery and it went against her beliefs. Granted that is small issue,but it was the fact about how childish you have to be to try and ruin a guys career because you read a story you did not like.Also how hypocritical people like Rose Mcgowan are when her friend asia argento was accused of sexual assault all of a sudden we are suppose to give due process. Hell no!!!
The left has been fucking up so much,and I do not think they realize how much they fucked up until they see the midterms. sorry for the long post,but it just boggles my mind how some of these people think.Like they really are stuck in their echo chambers and do not realize they have fucked up so badly. I see why some people are walking away
_Woodrow_ Not trying to pick a fight, so I won’t make replies in the thread. I’m just genuinely curious to your answers - and before you ask, no it’s not because I think it’s inconceivable that democrats would be authoritarian- just curious precisely what issues you are referring to when you say you are “walking away from Democrats’ authoritarianism”  What are examples that you consider to be democratic authoritarianism?
cons_NC &gt;The white liberal differs from the white conservative only in one way: the liberal is more deceitful than the conservative. The liberal is more hypocritical than the conservative. Both want power, but the white liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the Negro's friend and benefactor; and by winning the friendship, allegiance, and support of the Negro, the white liberal is able to use the Negro as a pawn or tool in this political "football game" that is constantly raging between the white liberals and white conservatives.

mimefortheblind I'm an old (gen x) guy who remembers how bad it was to break free of the hive mind 25-30 years ago.  
I can only imagine it's much, much harder and more painful today.  


It may be bad now. You'll lose friends, you'll get harassed. But in the future those of you millenials who chose to #walkaway will ber emembered as the strong and the brave and the wise of your generation.  


It won't happen right away. But that is how history will remember you.

myg0dd On the front page of reddit is an article from Politifact claiming Trump is false in stating that Google brings mostly biases searches.. According to them, places like CNN, Washington Post, and HuffPo are "incorrectly labeled left wing." I won't even get started on how delusional you would have to be to believe CNN isn't left wing, but I will point out how ridiculously left wing Politifact is. According to them, [Ted Cruz is false in claiming boys and girls can shower together because "transgender boys aren't girls.](https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2016/jun/26/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-makes-mostly-false-claim-about-obama-dire/) So yeah, basically Politifact is "non-biased" as long as you think boys and girls who claim to be the opposite sex are objectively stating facts. Fuck that crazy bullshit.  Right now r/politics is trying to pass off Politifact as "legitimate and non-biased"..
DapperShatter Let's be real: both the right and the left have pretty bad extremists. But it seems the the left has far more that are incredibly outspoken and angrily screaming, at least in my opinion. From what I could tell during the 2016 presidential election (and the closing 2018 federal election), there are a lot of liberals who have a brain and are willing and able to hold reasonable debate and discussion with the opposite party, but they've been drowned out by the crazies on their side. 

So, what are the numbers for your side?

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr- How many in the left are crazy, and how many are normal?

&amp;#x200B;

If this is phrased awkwardly, sorry, am currently swamped in homework and had this random thought lol. How split are the left?
Patoarch12 This is really catchy and funny. I guess since all #walkaway are Russian bots according to the fake news media it makes this even more amusing. Fake News Remix - Donald Trump vs. The Mainstream Media

WhyIsEveryNameTake Hi,
I've been looking at this sub for some time (never posted because I didn't need to walk away (proud republican) ). But now my brother (who was a centrist) bought a Maga pet!
It's the small actions that show that the democrats are getting smaller.
 Longtime lurker
XxXmomotraderxX This isn’t a walkaway post in the sense that I’m leaving the democrat party but a post about how I feel it’s necessary to walk away from social media itself. Platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, seem to be pushing their agenda like crack to depressed teenagers with parental abandonment issues. Despite only having 1/3 of the vote they feel it’s necessary to silence the other 1/3. 

1/3 of the population decides how the other 2/3rds should live, act, talk and think then there’s a problem. The McCain funeral was it for me. This was the last straw, it was a week long televised celebration of the swamp they say doesn’t exist. It was like every member of the swamp decided to come out into the public’s eye and show the world who they are.  

The social media elites want you to ignore their obvious bias all the while collecting billions from you while calling you a racist and bigot for supporting a president that is actually representing the people. Today I delete my Facebook, Twitter and Reddit profiles and I won’t be looking back. No longer can any of them make money from my membership and at the same time make me out to be a racist white supremacist simply for supporting a president that supports America. 

I say good riddance and goodbye. I walk
KyBMN https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9c4hjv/the_republican_party_keeps_convincing_me_i_was/?st=JLL3LN4A&amp;sh=9c5aea94 So what do you have to say about this?
MimiCan I was doing some casual googling and came across an article about former progressive playwright, David Mamet (Glengarry Glenn Ross), and how he became a conservative about a decade ago. Wow! I never heard anything about it back then, but I bet he’d make a powerful #WalkAway video  David Mamet!
ShouldBeStudying4CFA The party I once called my own from birth to age 24 has disappeared. Formerly the party of free trade and small government, it's now the party of stifling world trade, ginormous budgets, and worshipping a government leader -- completely ignoring the ridiculously huge amount of lies and flaws he has.

But it's okay because 'the wall'. Once we build that um...crime will totally disappear.


Watching as climate change turned from an issue that both sides were willing to tackle to a suddenly partisan issue was a huge catalyst for me to walk away from my party as well. Like, this is basic science. Milankovich cycles can't explain the ridiculous rise of CO2 in our atmosphere. When I saw this being debated on like Tucker or Hannity, their argument was 'I'm a skeptic'. How is that an argument?


Which gets me to another problem I had with the right -- blatant anti-intellectualism. Hey guys, I don't like liberal arts classes that awkwardly push social justice. I don't like when protestors get conservative speakers cancelled. But why does this new right seem to hate *all* educational institutions that aren't owned by Jerry Falwell suddenly? Why all the hate against scientists and social scientists just because they do research that the reader doesn't care about? It's the 'frivolous' studies that create a foundation towards the serious ones.

We have an economy propped up because of low interest rates and kept alive a little longer with a huge corporate tax cut (one of the things Trump did right), but global economies are starting to trend downwards, and when we fall down with them, we won't have interest rates to cut to soften our fall. We won't have all the bridges we're burning and trade agreements we've been nixing with our allies to help us quickly rebuild.

PLEASE GO BACK TO BEING THE PARTY OF FREE TRADE. PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS MAN MADE. Because right now, the Democrats are the only ones doing either. And even if the former is just a side they're taking because Trump is on the other one, it's the right one. So I'm going to continue to walk away from the other party. Walking away from the party I grew up with
Runner_one I can't even watch it. Never in my life have I seen such a ridiculous farce be the left. 

It is behavior like this that caused me to walk away from the Democrats years ago.

stockphotoframe Spacy post title, but it's hard to put into words. 

I began questioning the leftist narrative fairly recently. I was doing Google searches like "former liberal turned conservative" and not coming up with much. I heard of the walkaway movement and thought, oh! That's me! When I searched it, everything that came up was saying it was just Russian trolls. But I'm an honest to God person who has literally left the left. Yet my experience is being deemed fake.

I found this sub so tell me, are we real? Is this real? Are we really people who have walked away? Or am I one person screaming into a void of trolls and robots?

First hit when you Google "WalkAway" is this article from the Washington Post, saying how this movement isn't one at all - [link](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/07/02/the-walkaway-meme-is-what-happens-when-everything-is-viral-and-nothing-matters/).

Yet here I am. I was excited to hear about WalkAway, but when I searched it, I was told it's a fake movement. Is this real?
doofface99 Firstly, Brandon Straka got [banned from Facebook](https://twitter.com/usminority/status/1039928372212707328). This greatly reduces his ability to get out the word about his [#WalkAway March on Washington](http://walkawaymarch.com/). We're an official extension of the #WalkAway movement and we need to help Brandon get out the word about this march since he is losing part of his platform to spread the word. So, everybody blast out the website link (http://walkawaymarch.com/) on Facebook and everywhere else online! Tell everybody about the march and get them to pass it on! If you have family or friends in the DC area who may be interested in attending, let them know about it!

And even more censorship here on Reddit. The popular subreddit r/greatawakening was banned today, four hours ago, with over 70,000 thousand subscribers. Despite Reddit admins claiming that the ban was in part because of ["dissemination of personal information"](https://media.8ch.net/file_store/f3a1c35149a1c0d1f177917c70c8447cc6cd57c2b5f79424714e9dbcf25245b2.png), they have also banned r/Qanon and r/thegreatawakening, similar subreddits related to Q, indicating that this is simply a purge on the Q community. Whether you believe in Q or not, this ban should alarm you. 

Yet another reason that people are walking away. They will not silence us.

Spread the word. PSA: The social media censorship purge was hard at work today to silence all conservative-leaning voices.
Myrtlethecat The mods have gotten together and are attempting to convince the admins to shut down any subs that don’t lean to the left. It was the alt-right subs first but they have a list of other subs they want banned and it seems to encompass any sub containing wrongthink. You can go to thebanout2018 sub to find more information. You may have to do a bit of digging.

I don’t know if they know of this sub but I’d imagine them wanting to censor it if or when they do. I just wanted to give you all a heads up. People are using voat as an alternative. For those of you who may not be aware, reddit is going on a ban spree
blais2 Who shall be the first to throw the hammer into the screen! 1984
myg0dd [This is the actual sub dedicated to the ban-wave.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBanout2018/comments/9fd4o5/theyre_scared_heres_how_we_know/) They outright brag about being on some LARPING crusade to *fight hate!* They are even going after r/actualgirls for simply being a sub dedicated to non-transwomen. Other subs include /r/Gendercritical, /r/Transgenderkids. Now you may ask why there are 2 or 3 left leaning subs added to the mix, and that's because they are undesirable subs that have constantly been used as ammo and examples of the retarded left. Remember to vote in November so we can witness another full-blown meltdown after defeat.  Proof Reddit is going after right-leaning subs
myg0dd Let this put into perspective the type of shit reddit is willing to do to make sure the lefty platform stays on top. Biological girls can't even talk about their issues without getting banned since trannies can't chime in with their delusions.  R/actualgirls has been banned because it was a sub dedicated to non-trans biological women.
myg0dd This is how far they are trying to go to anything that isn't left leaning in anyway leading up to November. You know what to do to hand them another defeat  R/actualgirls Was just banned for being dedicated to biological women. Just being an actual girl is a bannable offense
seagull1106 Reddit deleting and censoring. Following in the footsteps of FB &amp; Twitter. I see going before Congress in their future. Will they lie like Zuckerberg &amp; Jack?  Goodbye Reddit. RIP. Walking away from reddit

&gt; Isn't this promoting division rather than unity?
Widely, yes, I do think so. What I don't believe is that that's neccesarily a bad thing. My primary goal with this tagger is to tag users of hate subreddits. I.e. the kind of users that cannot be reasoned or compromised with. These users are known to intentionally troll other subreddits, posing as innocuous members who *agree, but just have some concerns about the way you're presenting yourself*. This is known as concern trolling. Ultimately, the goal of these concern trolls is to water down the message of the community into a less effective message, in order to weaken their position. By identifying those who are engaging in bad faith, we save time for those who may otherwise engage the bad actors in their concern trolling.

"Isn't this eerily similar to gold-starring Jews before the holocaust?

&gt; I've had people make that connection before. However, until I start genociding people I've tagged, or they are discriminated against by a government entity, that comparison isn't really valid. Additionally, participation in certain subs is entirely voluntary. No user is forced to post in a hate sub.

https://masstagger.com  is the website and the user is u / morpen  (intentionally broken to avoid the notification to them). I feel that the user history shows they are intentionally targeting subreddits and abusing the Reddit API in violation of the TOS, if you feel they are abusing Reddit you can contact the admins over this as well.  **ALERT** A Firefox &amp; Chrome add-on was created to target and harass this sub and identified this a "hate sub"
AllenLombax I’m not even kidding. I got downvoted over 100 times for talking about the missing supplies in Puerto Rico.
myg0dd [It's amazing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/08/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-death-toll.html) though how [everyone was](http://academic.uprm.edu/wrolke/research/Maria%20Deaths%20-%20Significance.pdf) only reporting [~1,000 deaths](http://periodismoinvestigativo.com/2017/12/nearly-1000-more-people-died-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-maria/) months ago...  Democrats are saying Trump is criticizing the Puerto Rican numbers without evidence
syntheticadvice This is a new low for Democrats. I first posted the Texas Tribune article to /r/texan and then multiple other Texas based subreddits. What should have been a cause to celebrate turned into yet another political shitstorm. All because Trump might get credit for the success. 

I was also the victim of an organized vote manipulation ring in /r/Austin. The lengths that they are willing to go to hide any positive information is shocking. 

Here's the article: https://www.texastribune.org/2018/09/13/texas-poverty-census-2017-lowest-levels-decade/

 Texas Democrats are seething because poverty levels are now lower than they have been in more than a decade.
Line_man53 I just got here from r/GreatAwakening . RIP. I just want to say that this censorship is the most anti American thing I have ever had done to me. And to make matters worse I still have yet to see even a shred of evidence that any of these subreddits have spread hate or anything of the such. I also would like to say that the other day some scumbag came into the sub and tried stirring up islamophobia by making a post asking how we’d feel about Q being Muslim. Ofcourse no one fed into the bs except one guy but it’s one person in our subreddit. So I’m saying this because I believe that people who are NOT for the movement infiltrate and cause a commotion in the subreddit purposefully for this MASS CENSORSHIP. To other qultists, it was a great ride and thank you for waking me up to the evils in this world. Stay vigilant patriots #WWG1WGA  Qfugee
PitoStinko So I get a lot of flak from both my right-leaning friends and leftists I argue with, about my theory that Hillary Clinton is going to run again.  Well, I think we may have kind of a teaser announcement in this article I will post at the bottom of this post.  

She spoke at an event known as, Lesbians Who Tech Summit.  With a typical SJW sychophant interviewing her while drooling at her every comma, Hillary answered questions about what is in her Netflix watch list and fascist proposals such as nationalizing social media.  Pay attention to the messaging here, it is as if she is a couple of months from a presidential election, running with the SAME MESSAGE!  Same fucking message!  And being asked these rapid-fire questions is just a way to psychologically sweep away any recollections of her poor health as we all remember.

Here are the question and answer from the Queen that I am referring too...

SJW Sycophant- “What’s that one thing that, if it happened, you would know your work is done? For me, it’s having a black lesbian president. For you, what is your moonshot?”

Queen of Antifa- “Wow, well can I have two moonshots?”

SJW Sycophant- “You can have whatever you want.”

Queen of Antifa- “Obviously one of them is having a woman president, which I think would make such a difference. And the other is once and for all getting to universal healthcare coverage that covers everything. So you know, I’m going to keep trying to make the first one happen, and keep working to make the second happen eventually.”

Now does that sound like someone who is going to sit this next one out?  To me, it sounds like someone who really wants to be the first female president, and to her credit, someone who isn't going to give up that dream.  What the hell do I know, though?  I am just a dumb Redhat from the South.

 Yep... She's definitely going to run again. And yes, the Left are the Fascists of today.
PitoStinko I am referring to the rounds he recently did for the mainstream media.  Seriously, these comments are pathetic.  It is as if they somehow hired out of touch adults from the 1970s.  These comments are all roughly a week old, most of them 5 days to a month in some cases.  They are so pathetic that they are literally the earmark for astroturfing.  I mean it is bad, folks.  Every other comment is talking about how good looking Avenetti is, there are embarrassing uses of emojis to substitute words like strong, "Avenetti is so 💪", words used like young/fighter/strong/handsome thrown around every other comment. 

I can't stress how obviously this astroturfing is.  I mean, Share Blue was pretty bad, but at least their comments were sometimes edgy and interesting, they also knew how to reference normie memes into their jabs at Trump, but these Avenatti comments...  No kidding, it is like they were created by someone using the internet for the first time and told to start a trend.

In case you are wondering why this is happening, Avenatti recently announced a run at the White House in 2020.  He is obviously just fodder to establishment Democrats, a punching bag so they can sneak in whom they've always wanted, Hillary Clinton.  The biggest mistake that can be made here by the right is not punching.  The guy clearly can't handle pressure and sweats like a pornstar when hooking and jabbing with the opposition, as seen in his recent interview with Tucker Carlson.

But seriously Avenatti campaign, take some notes from Share Blue and David Brock.  Because you are doing it wrong. Would you like to see what astroturfing looks like in 2018? Take a look in the comment section for any recent Avenatti videos.

I am a gay conservative.

I am tired of being generalized as a liberal (and other things) because of something as small as my sexual orientation. That is literally the tiniest detail of my life.

I think LGBT culture is a good thing (Pride parades, drag, craziness). It is something that our previous generations needed to get by and something to escape to when society said "you are not one of us". If I was openly gay even ten years ago, life would be a lot more difficult. Life is still difficult for some of the LGBT community, especially the transgender community. We have made a lot of progress though. It is 2018 and as a gay man, I do not feel oppressed in society, and that is a privilege I appreciate to have in America while other countries behead people like me. What I dislike are political groups taking the LGBT community and using us as a platform to spread fear and ideologies assuming that we cannot think for ourselves.

The things I want in life are simple. I want my Fiance and I to have a nice comfortable life, I want children one day, I want a house and maybe even open up a successful business. I won't go into specific details about my political opinions, but point being: I think for myself.

I already expect to get backlash from this reddit page based off of a lot of posts I've seen here (hopefully I'm wrong), but I really think what I'm saying is important. Do I think other people need to have the same political and moral opinions as myself? Certainly not, but people need to think for themselves.

Society tells us that we HAVE to support everything that is 'left'. I am gay so I need to be a democrat. We are an easy target. They use our insecurities and vulnerabilities to tell us that we need them. We don't need them. We are better and stronger than that.

Before you decide to have an opinion on something, do ample research. Don't stick to regular news sources or Facebook. When I say this, I'm not assuming that you as the reader is not intelligent enough to do so, but for a while I was trapped into certain ways of thinking when I was in high school and in college. I always knew the left was "for gay marriage" so I always leaned towards that side, so naturally I adopted every other liberal policy as my own.

It wasn't until I started researching specific issues myself (this was about a year ago) that I started putting together my own political opinions and I have to say I can breath a little easier knowing about specific issues and having my own opinion that CNN didn't give me (even if I happen to agree with what they say).

I think nowadays, a lot of liberals are bigots. Yes, I used that word, usually used for right wing conservatives. It is defined as "a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions". and that is something that is very true. Whenever I express a opinion that isn't liberal (usually backed by statistics and data) its like my gay card is removed and I'm just some pile of horse sh\*t. Most media is liberal, and it is the more widely accepted political side.

To sum this up: I am not a product, I am not a poster child for any political party or organization, I am a normal person and my sexual orientation does not define who I am as a person.

In case anyone is interested, Brandon Straka, a member of the LGBT community, is the spokesperson for the #WalkAway movement. It is constantly growing and its really awesome to see others who feel the same way as I do. Here is the original video he posted: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51UGcghHZsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51UGcghHZsk)

ThrombBone Where do people "go" when they walkaway? It wouldn't make sense to join the ranks of the R's since they are just as corrupt as the D's, so instead of red or blue, are people familiar with the gold option and know about people like Libertarian Larry Sharpe, instead?  Walkaway - to where?
JdaVoCap This user is beyond sick-and-tired of the drama, especially faked drama, with people on all sides self-false-flagging into the spotlight for 'narratives' in this post-fact, post-activism world.

As S t e v e W o l a n y k said at Anarchapulco 2018, 'activism does not work.'

Really think [insert favorite/hated thieving, murdering, molesting, cannibalizing, sell-out poli-tic(k)ian's name here be it] cares about some paid-off and/or brain-washed collective marching around chanting corporate buzzwords, most being 'identitarians' which are narcissism incarnate as analyzed by one J o a n n a W i l l i a m s?

The hypocrisy is not bound to the 'other', in this case, 'the [radical]left', however, the very same 'right-wing'. On FNC even the Tuck is guilty of straw-manning and using other under-handed debate tactics as those in the usual YT channel 'exposure'/'clap-back response' videos outlined in one '1 9 8 4 and Philosophy' by S c o r r i e, yet are not nearly called out as much on it as it would be if it happened on say, (MS)NBC. As also noted in 'The Righteous Mind' by H a i d t, these 'talking-heads', as they are commonly called, fall into the trap, or are at least very much at-risk of, offering only 'sugar and salt' (feel-good platitudes for a particular victim-class audience and sour criticism for their oppressor-class 'boogeyman').

This world is continuing to further the eschaton and boils down to merely a flawed H e g e l i a n D i a l e c t i c of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, or in another way of putting it, problem-reaction-solutionism a la the Shirky principle that ignores the Peter/Pareto Principles, as typical 'leftist' policies tend to do, and the result is the disregarded human condition coming back every.single.time. to destroy such a system and create 'glitches' in this 'Matrix'.

Take this past election cycle for example. Don't try to deny in the least bit the push-over-the-hill for getting the sitting President into office was to 'vote against' the 'other', as many did for the other candidate, as opposed to those who were vehemently ardent supporters of either (also possible back-door deals with the military versus the 'deep state' supporters of certain alien species that are hostile to humanity, possibly in Antarctica). Thesis: What looks to be like a Kuru-afflicted governmental candidate spouting off the usual 'globalist' progressive-regressive post-modern, inter-sectional agit-prop talking points antithetical to the human condition and Hobbsian interventionalism for Malthusiahn reasons. Antithesis: Possibly a cousin of said candidate and businessman who has used crony-capitalist tactics in the past appealing to a slightly smaller-scale form of tribalism in a flurry of reactionism, tantamount to, sometimes by some people, trolling.

If one has read 'Antifragile' by T a l e b, it shows tables indicating the difference in learning and production of those who subscribe to such beliefs categorized in those tables, namely Procrustean/Epithean 'backwords' fragile and robust learning and doing, and Promethean-style (the notion is that, alien or not, this was a relatively-friendly entity to humanity compared to many other entities of similar size and power) antifragile learning and doing.

For example: naive and/or gullible student-professor colloquies versus cynical and/or arrogantly presumptuous real-world experience as a trucker or someone stationed in an exotic/foreign location, neither being truly 'complete' and 'healthy' forms of learning and doing, compared to antifragile forms such as skeptical library/bookstore-perusing and comparing-and-contrasting.

This is further expounded upon by one M a r k P a s s i o at Anarchapulco 2018 and 'What on Earth is happening' events. On one hand, there are right-brain-dominant herd-minded 'anti-fascists' programmed with fear pr0n and believe it/most-anything told since birth by helicopter parents; on the other hand, one has a more-or-less left-brain-dominant 'alt-right'/'alt-lite' (ultra/ethno-)nationalist crowd, both with football-team mentalities/checklists of criteria for what belief or action or dress or rhetoric is categorized as 'theirs', with almost any exception being cause for ouster and ostricization or worse, a la 'The Obsolete Man' TwilightZone episode (or any particular suspense/thriller/horror-genre movie on group dynamics, such as 'The Faculty').

The trick is to be as much of a reasonable, rational, skeptical antifragile Promethean teacher-student with access to power from and for both hemispheres of one's brain. However, as Y a r o n B r o o k of the AynRandInstitute posited, 'the group cannot reason'. The group is incapable of reason, only the individual is. To become de-individualized, one is effectively anti-human(ist) and de-actualized (according to the works of Doctors C a r l J u n g and J o r d a n B P e t e r s o n), and anti-truth, which is fundamentally a M a r k P a s s i o and S t e f a n M o l y n e u x definition of Satahnic. This whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts thought-process of 'muh greater good' is the primary driving force behind most-all tragedies and population reductions (artificial ones, but some natural because of artificial involvement, more on that later in this piece). The needs of the many do not (ought not) outweigh the needs of the few, or the one, which is the line-of-thinking in most StarTrek movies and shows that didn't go full-SJW-commie and remained reasonably 'classically liberal'. This is important because all too often today are too many people willingly and unwillingly giving up or being robbed of their agency, capital, labor, property, resources, knowledge and wisdom in favor of another and given a social-issue as a reason, when all wars are fought for resources (economic reasons) and the social issues are just 'sugar and salt' that do not hit on all taste-buds.

Some may ask: 'What is 'classical liberalism'? What is 'liberal' (in the modern context) and the difference between the two? What are 'libertarian' and 'Libertarian' and the difference between them?' What is 'conservative'? 'What are Democrats and Republicans?' 'What are the 'left' and 'right'?

Well here's the answers all in an effort to combat the dehumanizing misrepresentation and conflation and other underhanded tactics of 'the powers that be' and those ignorant or brainwashed by them:

Classical liberalism is a doctrine, liberalism has no metaphysical principles, and libertarianism is a philosophy. Eso explained this recently.

To be principally liberal is originally an economic term, not a social one until later, and began when most in early, rudimentary parliaments and courts and political forums out-reaching and giving, (spend-indulgent) individuals would sit on the 'left' side of those chambers and to be principally conservative, also originally an economic term, not a social one until later, began when individuals would sit on the 'right' side of those chambers and advocate for, as one good doctor puts it, 'sorting one's self out first before others'. Liberal means/nt freedom, whereas conservative became constrictive, in the negative connotation. The root word for liberal means 'free', in the etymology.

Liberalism, however, became 'hi-jacked', seen by a savage some as a 'mental disease', over time by 'progressives'. This was pointed out in the aforementioned '1 9 8 4 and Philosophy' and 'The Righteous Mind'. Many enlightenment philosophers championed 'classical liberalism' that included 'laissez-faire capitalism'/free markets with little-to-no governmental oversight and letting it all 'be'. The split in question happened when these systems became seen as 'achieved', rather than 'achievable' and once achieved, the 'neo-liberal' connotation took over, which was one of needing protectionism of such freedom. This, however, is antithetical to such freedom and has led to nothing but regression from the mean of that which was wanted for the inequities of those less fortunate, commonly used as a poster-boy. Labor unions and parties for the 'common man' took shape. Equality and equity are two different things, or at least not always one and the same, as with percentages, mathematically.

This world is a world of scarcity, of finite resources, or at least a low-time-preference for it to re-create those resources, without the violence of nature and not everything everyone wants is scattered evenly everywhere, perhaps not even what is needed either, in terms of survival.

This however creates 'glass-ceilings' for those who want what is wanted, thinking an arbitrary agency of flawed people, the 'heel' of those who have little-to-no-faith in humanity's ability to transcend their circumstances and better themselves, perhaps to a better/next plane of existence or being, in some circles. Look at MMO videogames/computer games. Say a level 99 player goes into a low-level area and challenges many level 1 players to attack their avatar with a handicap for those lower levels that consists of the level 99 player being 'taxed' of their armor and weapons and companions and offering a jackpot-sum of in-game currency to whomever could slay that avatar. The level 1s all crowd around and for hours on end, even with a near-nude avatar of the level 99 character, do no damage or miss their attacks, yet could still be beaten themselves by nothing more than base-stat-backed rudimentary attacks, while the level 1s are still in their own armor and armed. Figuratively 'clipping one's wings' to be raised out of a valley that periodically floods where all the greens are for sustenance circled by predators above to avoid such a fate as that of 'natural selection' in favor of a hilltop with thinner air and less greens, yet a shorter distance for the predators to swoop down and feat upon the populace is tantamount to what socialism is, ineffective, inefficient (although that is usually prized and may even increase slightly, for a time) and self-harming.

How many tragedies have happened because of impatient and impulsive individuals began to see in the plural, and not singular and consisted of many cowards and psychopaths and ignorant masses wanted something done about a threat quickly, that they prized efficiency over effectiveness and ultimately screwed themselves or were screwed by those who caused such a need/want? Slow and steady wins the race, or at least can appear to with the proper trickery.

True as a former President, H e r b e r t H o o v e r once said along the lines of, 'an economic problem must be solved economically, not by political oversight.', so too is true of the saying by one, late, A n d r e w B r e i t b a r t that, 'politics is downstream from culture'. Well too many who even re-iterate such rhetoric buy into wanting what they claim to not want or is antithetical to their wants, whether they know it or not (which is another hole-to-a-tea-party in and of itself as to their intentions and true level of knowledge). While politics may be downstream from culture (thus culture being the issue, and not the politics, which cannot save culture, rather be affected by it), whether or not race/creed (if religion is not counted as culture and regardless of ethnicity within the handful of races, if one subscribes to those being different things and one having fewer categories than the other) is upstream from culture is irrelevant because environment is the ultimate source, what is ultimately upstream of all of these, also as one M a r k P a s s i o talked about.

Case-in-point: The environment of a chain of islands is rocky with little farming ground and resources, so any populace who chooses to settle there for whatever original reasons and do not venture far from there tends to turn to a form of fierce (re: violently enforced) distributism, a la feudal Japan, expanding upon the family units' grouping into villages and those becoming a part of tribes, into inter-tribal relations, because there is not enough to go around if all have a 'free-for-all' and stick to nomadic pastoralism.

Democrats are members of a political party, as are Republicans, and one does not need to be a member to vote for candidates of either cartel. Generally liberals and conservatives are what is consisted of within the Democratic Party and Republican Party, respectively, but not entirely. The left-right terminology is that of where one individual lands on a given 'political spectrum' (whether or not which one is to be believed or the efficacy of such is a whole 'nother story) being separated by an 'X-axis' and 'Y-axis' of ideology and methodology, respectively, with authoritarian (statism or not, but usually statist; involuntarily association and disassociation) and libertarian off the 'X-axis' (up and down) and collectivism ('the needs of the many...') and individualism (primacy of the individual's Rights over the collective force) off of the left and right sides of the 'Y-axis', respectively.

The left-right paradigm is a false paradigm and it really boils down to an up-down/north-south (as with the poles on a planet such as Earth), because it's either an individual (king/deity; tyranny) enforcing their will over someone or many, or a group, either an oligarchy or democracy enforcing their will over an individual or many in the name of either their supposed smartest (best-and-brightest of the village and tribe of Republicanism) or yoking-two-yakz and regressing to the lowest common denominator (ignorant) having say over someone's life and personal agency. The problem is collectivism (forced/involuntary collectivism) versus individualism (voluntar[y]ism).

The top-left is communism (whether or not it's been tried successfully or not in real life is another story), then going downward to the right-side: socialism, democracy, fascism, monarchy/theocracy, republicanism[,/centrist], minarchy[,/]Libertarianism (capital 'L' for the party, not necessarily always in-line with actual libertarianism), Anarcho-capitalism/anarchy, just to name a few, with non-theocratic monarchism being the outlying tent-pole ideology to the top-right and hippie flower-power bus and compost pile communes Lib-Soc'ing being the bottom-left outlying tentpole ideology, An-Coms to the left of that up a tad bit).

Nazs/Bols/Nazbols are.not.right-wing. They are leftist. This is commonly conflated/misrepresented by all sides. Communism is the socialization of the goods and (means of) production of goods and fascism has several definitions/types: The BMuss definition of a group bolstering the individual...which does not work; the AHit definition of the socialization of people/corporatocracy; and the GOrwel pseudo-definition of 'Someone is an authoritarian and is not liked, meh!'. Both of these ideologies have socialist roots, just of different colored suits-and-ties and victim-classes. All have pre-set idealized ideals for a newborn to live and grow by or else is punished for, which is unhealthy and the problem here. Like a father pushing a daughter away from a particular boy, it only makes the pushed be pulled further into the arms of or pushed into the arms of regardless of any pull that boy. How many atheists are ex-Caths? So-on-and-so-forth.

However.....with a lessening of the environment, a 'paddock' of humanity (LV shooting from above conspiracies anyone?) a la from a walling off of half of an entire continent, poor, privacy-concerned individuals are impeded (thus an act of aggression has been levied upon them by those allegedly supposed to serve them, not rule them) without a toll/tax [obligatory 'taxation is theft' here, on the definition of a tax being involuntary, otherwise it's a subscription/bill] and/or 'doxxing' over land that is not owned/originally supposed to be owned by the federal State-form government as well as air (TSA shake-downs).

If one is all about that IQ-by-race stuff (while there may be a different 'floor' for some, on average, one should be judged upon their 'ceiling', like an MMO character creation screen. Just because one does not play the 'optimal' class and race by birth, does not mean they cannot achieve what is done in a Raid/Dungeon/quest/etc. others of other class-and-race combinations can do; Each activity is dynamic and changed in the 'group-finder' that is life and its side-quests as well, adapt to one's own play-style because skill &gt; stats....play around) then it should be noted that it would be harder for robust learning to be achieved (experience and safety elsewhere than one's origin point) and brought back to raise up their origin point to better standards from study elsewhere. Not everyone is rich or public/comfortable enough in their persona and psyche and ego to jump through so many hoops for so long, especially with the threat of violence and seeking refuge from it, usually perpetrated directly, or indirectly by the 'deep state' of the host/solute destination for an artificial mass-importation of incompatibility for nefarious purposes or not.

The result? Not destroying the welfare state as it should be destroyed but re-making it for just a different group of people, still involuntarily enforced and propped up, this time with less freedom of movement (i.e. escape) because a homogenized society (as noted by the Foundation for Economic Education) is the only source capable of hosting a successful welfare-State.

Oh, what about those who say borders/walls first, then when the welfare state is destroyed such can be abolished, or those outside have their IQ raised? Well, those outside, the 'other', will have a harder time raising theirs and will want to not end up in-breeding because everyone will have a smaller gene pool to pull from and make combinations out of that do not result in sterilization. Are some groups under attack, not usually seen as being oppressed in textbooks and mainstream education such as the heterosexual Caucasian/oid male? Absolutely, but the methodology to solve such an issue is where the disconnect is. Another is the fallacy of the assumed paradigm, also outlined and explained by the Foundation for Economic Education, in an article. One must put their prejudices for inter-racial couples (or whatever) aside because going around shouting what 'triggers' them, even if this user or a given person has and shares such a distaste in such couplings and associations, involuntarily forcing disassociation will only bring about ruin and is antithetical to the goal from the start. There is a difference between preferences, prejudices, and principles. It is important to categorize what one believes in the right categories, lest wisdom be fleeting. Everyone is entitled to their preferences and prejudices, and force is not the only or even best form of power, as evident in D a v i d H a w k i n g s' 'Power vs. Force' book. Look up D a l e C a r n e g i e's 'How to make friends and influence people' and the like from D o n G a b o r, as R o n a l d D w o r k i n once said tantamount to, 'This individual disagrees, but recognizes the other's moral responsibility.' The trick today, that is missing almost everywhere, is recognizing the position of the other and understanding it, despite disagreeing, and posit why the other is wrong, where, when, how, with what and who and most importantly, why, and propose alternative methodology.

Is one really admitting that someone should build something to be torn down only a few years later creating then destroying jobs which was never in the purview of the federal goverment in the first place with such money that is not there due to it being stolen over a decade ago during a false-flag terrorist attack perpetuated by the deep state and re-circulated by quantatively eased fiat petrodollars, lowering its value in a debt-based economy that could be better solved by the Confucian adjusting of the 'actions steps' and making the prior system 'obsolete' (a la B u c k m i n s t e r F u l l e r) through culture valuing a different form of money, of which as A d a m S m i t h said is 'imaginary' and 'individual ambition serving the common good.'?

As A r i s t o t l e had mentioned, in terms of Utility, Efficiency, Virtue, and Meriting security, communal property (public property, aka a wall/borders) does not work and should be abandoned in favor of private property only. It is far easier to figure out and maintain, cheaply, one's own individual private property and family as opposed to something, a social construct, that supposedly belongs to both parties in a given dispute. Mr. X and Mr. Y have their own houses, and when damaged, know its theirs to fix, but when a commonly owned park is damaged, it has less priority because it is not directly, inherently, important as one's own family. The cost, not necessarily money, by the way, is increased for both parties/all parties involved because there's more to cover and more to pool from for a given provider and consumer standpoint (it's not a healthcare problem it's an insurance problem, same with student loans, stop getting them, the institutions know they can be paid back through them, enslaving those who take them, like loansharking in the mafias with the State-government there to pick them up when screwed over later). There was an article by W e n d y M c E l r o y on Bitcoin.com about this and podcasts by the Cato Institute and libertarianism.org.

---TL;DR: If one focuses on allowing the solute populace to be armed and self-sufficient to hold off any potential aggression and the push/pull factors of immigration are eliminated (benefits to entice and fears to run from), it's a softer blow, if any at all, the 'powers that be' can import for nefarious purposes and get away with in the socio-political concern (voting undocumented people for democrats), economic concern ('takin'-r -erbz' cawkadoodledoo), and security concern (cartels from black markets from criminalizing of goods/services). Am working on something of a paper/argument with full ethos-logos-pathos appeals to each, like examples of times individuals and small, loosely-affiliated groups defeated larger, centralized collectives and more anarchic societies flourished with little-to-no-State-government. /thesis statement

Government means mind-control, and not all government is in the form of the State, but all States are governments, and one does not necessarily need government to live and transcend and keep their ego in-check, likewise for organized religion, all of these are forms of control by negative hyper-dimensional forces.

Identitarianism is cancer and narcissism inarnate and many alt-lite/right Ytuber content creators and news/commentary/skepto-sphere organizations/entities seem bought-n-paid for to misrepresent and conflate and sell fear pr0n and this user has (and others should) move away from them and focus on better things, with a positive spin, as M o t h e r T e r e s a once said, 'one will never find this person at an anti-war rally, but if holding a pro-peace rally, this one will be the first one there'.

It's mostly globalist neoliberal commie Bol-Gews vs. neocon fashy Zio-Gews, all socialist-rooted and can suck it! Openborders.info is pretty good as well as mises.org and EsotericEntity/TheDollarVigilante/LarkenRose/AdamKokesh despite some spin, if looking for less spin, which is nice to see, check out FEE.org and check out as many different sources as possible, because only one or two sources leads one down a dark path.

As RudyardKipling once said, 'Keep 5 noble servants, their names Who, what, when, where, why, and how.' Well too much is being emphasised on 'Mr. How' and not 'Mr. Why' who is left out in the cold and rain. No more band-aides, as M a r k P a s s i o said. Also, 'small miseries add up to the point a cannonball wouldn't hurt as much', let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater (as R a n d P a u l, son of Doctor R o n P a u l, said) because as a former president in RonaldReagan once said, 'Someone who agrees with one eighty-percent of the time and disagrees with one twenty-percent of the time is a friend and an ally, not a twenty-percent traitor.', mainstream 'right-wing' (not right-wing, no one gets more right than AnCaps, the default human position) para-political government-subsidized agitating/provoking punditth0tery for further balkanization is not healthy nor needed at this time, especially. The election cycle is over and more 'high-brow' content is needed, not 'slams'. Calling AnComs anarchists when the definition changed in 1927 and still doesn't mean what it's supposed to mean and libertarians 'lolbertarians' or anyone who is open-borders/only believes in private borders (if 4000 4 acre, or whatever, homesteads littered next to each other across the border to Mexico and all said 'no' to transit between these two regions of land, that's one thing, to screw over everyone over Europe's mistakes and bringing leftistism here as a solution and some handful of blown-out-of-proportion statistics equivocated for narratives is not an excuse) a 'soyboy snowflake virgin leftist commie globalist whatever' does.not.help.at.all. Either in the perception of what 'right-wing' is (thankz pohppah plant for the raypist and likewise for G Dubya Junior for swinging things that much easier to B H K S D ODronebombah and back again to TheDon....what's next The Big Ope'?) or anything leftists are associated with.

Is it not possible for a CEO to wear a tye-dye shirt? Is it not possible for a Trekkie to own a car? Is it not possible for a vegan to be a capitalist?

Stop seeing people for what they are and see them more for who they are, as individuals.

The free market fixes itself, it's easier for scarcity to be solved by competing for lower prices with no regulations over intellectual property (no such thing), thus, a food-replicator (3D printer) without the government trying to shut one down, making solving world hunger easier and cheaper for all, rather than someone who hates humanity sit on the patent. The space exploration and defense/offense and guarding of 'interests' overseas is all outfitted by companies anyways, the government does very little (mainly to avoid FOIA requests for acient alien-type information and black budget work in Antarctica and the like). Remember Gullivr's Travels? Imagine two giants on that island, one the economy the other the government. Too many blame the robotic economic giant that paces around the island in the same pattern rather than the government giant that wants to hide the midget people in the oven up the bean-stalk sometimes and is working with the other giant sometimes, in the form of corporations being recognized as special people, and has a more erratic pace around the island. If the government giant is slayed, the economic giant is more easily tripped and tied and stabbed later. There's only equipment enough to take down one of them, one's path is already known. It's an easy, simple choice.

Just because 'X', does.not.equate.to. 'Y'. Wash, rinse, repeat. Wash, rinse, repeat. Wash, rinse, repeat.

Insert H L Mecnkn quotes here about the government being nothing more than a gang of men like yuh and this user.

End citizenship at birth/14th Amend. No more anchor-babies, shouldn't need to birth in hospitals and get injected full of drugs and printed and documented anyways. If this user wants to free-birth and give organic substances too naturally and have the mothr of the child squat and deliver like primeapez are supposed to do, undocumented their whole lives, that's their own business.

People attack theorizing whatif scenarios yet advocate stockpiling guns.....against the government they claim to support too? Asinine. All while proposing ridiculous scenarios of armies of lazy Mexicans and ragheadchoppers the n W o with aircraft and watercraft are going to import anyways and think the same entity to going to prevent that than allow dangerous freedom to self-sufficiently deter such? Go to Europe and impede people's movements because NGOs are bringing 'em in then advocate government and non-'illegal' by law of man (superficial or redundant) ways of getting farmers in SAfrca out and defended with BBguns and waterbottles than just get on a free market boat and smuggle 'em out to a safe haven? Anarchapulco and Liberland could use some farmers....who wants to get on a boat and smuggle sum fine folk outta a heckhole by government, oh wait, that'd be eeeeleeeegaaall.....smh.

Trying to create bridges, not walls, here and not burn these bridges either. This is real life but it's also a FF video game series entry. This is an airship and there's a colorful cast of JRPG characters everywhere on the ship. That's real life.

One can have undocumented people within a 'country' (region) and let them buy, sell, trade, entertain, be entertained, work, etc., and just not have the benefits of being a member of a club known as a society, like a Costco membership, therefore no duties but no benefits and if they screw up they're toast, so don't f up! So.freaking.simple. Charge more money for undocumented customers in a restaurant than citizens and undocumented people will leave that region! Duh! See costumed thugs in gear with guns, this user doesn't get just triggered but is looking to pull some, that's Not.Needed.

Oh, btw, What.Is.With.This.'Spartan' 'A' symbol theme going around, esp with the identitarian narcissists? The Athenians repelled the horde, not the Spartans, they dyed gloryhounds while the philosophers properly planned things out that were made fun of earlier by the jocks. Brains over braun. Every time. Pragmatism is impatience. Impulsiveness. Be more principled/idealistic people. Please. One does not have to be a naive/cynical ideologue, blind to everything else, nor a cynical/naive realist, but combine the two.....and one gets idealist. It's etymological mathematics people! Real-ist+ide-ologue = idealist. Get it? Good nyt that's r show for tonyt!
 Instead of just walking away from Democrats (or Republicans), how about walking away from this sick, sick game both play?: An insomniac, AnCap-minded human writes an Op-Ed calling for a return of Reason
Dylan_Darko r/WhatWasYourRedPill
WALK AWAY
u/Dylan_Darko
I know firstly many of you will say Dylan you call yourself progressive yet you're in with the Republicans? cue heads exploding

I would like to remind you that the first Progressive party in this nation was founded by Teddy Roosevelt. It was an idea of looking out for the American first, for busting up Monopoly and special interest that had come to dominate the common man. It then went to Progressives under FDR and Wallace. What we see today is not Progressive. It is Regressive and the Dems own it.

You cannot claim to be progressive and shut down free speech.

You cannot claim to be progressive and seek to take the means of the common man to defend himself from an oppressive government.

You cannot claim to be progressive and want equality for women and then wear a Hijab while Iranian women are being locked up for refusing to wear them.

You cannot claim to be progressive and want equality for LGBT folks while siding with a religion that kills these people in their country for being who they are

You cannot claim to be progressive while silencing artist you do not agree with politically

You cannot claim to be progressive and support trade policies that have shafted the American worker for decades

You cannot be progressive if you want an open border. Immigrants come in and work for lower wages, they take benefits designed to help Americans and it is the citizen who suffers for it. Should the standard of living not be raised for citizens first and a merit based immigration system be implemented? Regressives say no

You cannot be progressive and get your news spoonfed to you by media giants with an agenda while casting those who seek to free You (Assange,Snowden) as the enemy. You are living in the dark. OPEN YOUR EYES

You cannot be progressive and support a religion that hasn't changed or had a major reformation in its 1400 year existence

You cannot be a progressive who wants equality for all while you spend your days attempting to further divide everyone into easily defined little boxes or tribes. "Out of the many. ONE" One people. One Nation. With Liberty (to be who we want to be) and justice (equal treatment under the law) for ALL

You cannot be progressive if you seek to roll back the rights and freedoms guaranteed to us at birth as inalienable rights. The founders of this nation had the foresight to know what would keep us free and your attempts to destroy those rights show who you really are enemies to the republic

I use to think the Left cared about the common man. I use to think the Left was the party of Kennedy, Wallace, FDR. The left today is the party of Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot. They want us all marching along to The same beat where individuality is gone but there is plenty of guilt and shame for all.

The left today seeks to indoctrinate and manipulate. They are quick to play victim and are blind to their own tyranny. Victimhood is the soil from which the tree of fascism grows but the Tree of Liberty grows from the blood of patriots and tyrants. Throw off the chains of mental slavery, none but yourself can free your mind, and WALK AWAY

So when was my redpill? I voted Bernie in the primary, knew I would never support Hillary for ANY reason! After seeing Bernie kiss the ring and start supporting Hillary and her corruption I literally became ill. My vote for Trump was a FU to Hillary. I wasn't fully on board with MAGA yet but knew I didn't want Hillary.1) Watching Hillary say before the election that she didn't think Donald would accept the results if he lost, how it was a cornerstone of a democracy to have a peaceful transition of power then her go on a 2 year blame everyone else but herself tour while stoking division 2) watching the media pump nothing but Russia Hysteria nonsense 3) watching as Trump brings peace to Korea and liberals still demonize him 4) added to all the points I made about who is a progressive and who is Regressive was my red pill moment. Thanks for reading Why I walked away
myg0dd Once again they claim to be the party that will vilify men over an unsubstantiated claims from nearly 40 years ago without due process. To any normal person that isn't mentally retarded or a delusional far leftist, we've experienced life and realized the value and importance of things like 'evidence' or 'proof.' I really don't get it though. How do they not realize they are shooting themselves in the foot by acting like immature cry babies who wants to change the rules to suit themselves? The best part about this Kavanaugh controversy is how bad Dems are making themselves look
WanderingCapybara Former boomer conservatism and fundie Christianity living with my parents, to moderately leftwing atheist for the first year on my own, but something didn't quite feel right.

Then I got really into politics I remember my watershed #RedPillMoment when I thought, I'll give this video with "racist bigot" Faith Goldy and Gavin McInnes a chance expecting it to be really repulsive like the traditional right I was used to. But it wasn't, it was surprisingly reasonable and well-humoured, "the enemy" wasn't nearly as bad as I thought and from their I've taken more red pills and I'm happy to call myself a rightwing atheist.

Since I've realized that I've finally really found my people! I love listening to Jordan Peterson, Stefan Molyneux and watching Lauren Southern, Faith Goldy, Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro! The dying mainstream media and cucked leftist YouTube channels like Vox, Vice &amp; MTV make up all sorts of lies and fake news about them because they don't want people to wake up and take the red pill and I've never regretted it! Now I see through the smoke and mirrors and I'm happy to be part of this community! #WalkAway #TakeTheRedPill So happy to walk away! I finally found my people!
NoobifiedSpartan I’ll try and make this short and sweet. I grew up in the Northern suburbs of Illinois, and for as long as I love this place has been a heavily concentrated hub for —socialists— Democrats, with my brother being one of many people who adopted their twisted ideologies. Growing up, I was never really heavily informed about politics. I usually went off of what I heard and joined the masses in my area, not entirely sure why I was saying what I was saying. My parents never really tried to influence me politically, and I can’t thank them enough for that, but the mobs still spoke out and I followed suit. For a while there I lived in ignorance, but eventually I started researching politics. More and more I felt myself drift away from the party I became so aquatinted with, until eventually the nail in the coffin hit when I found Ben Shapiro. I loved watching him and found myself agreeing with more and more of his ideologies as I researched them. I kept learning more facts about more political issues, and that knowledge permanently severed me from the Democrats. I realized that I was living a lie for so long, ignoring the truth when I thought I already knew it. Becoming a Republican was an incredible decision on my part, and I only wish I did it sooner.   Been a Republican for several years now, but it wasn’t always that way...
ChakanGenesis This might actually be a bit late, as the school year has started or is starting for a lot of college students, but it needs to be said anyway. Let's open up with a very simple thought experiment:

Alice intends to develop the next wave of powerful therapies, with an eye towards anti-cancer, rejuvenative biotechnology, and similar research areas. She's taking introductory biology courses for her first year but intends to get into the harder stuff ASAP.
Bob is taking pre-med courses and fully intends to be a front-line medical practitioner. He's not sure if he wants to specialize or just become a family doctor, but he knows that he wants to be Bob, MD.
Charlie believes that he, personally, will be the one to make nuclear fusion work. He's taking physics and engineering courses to accomplish this, and he'd like to intern at Lockheed-Martin as soon as he can.
Deborah intends to be an electrical engineer and is taking courses to match, developing smart household devices that reduce the amount of electricity consumed. She strongly believes that people with old, inefficient equipment need to be able to afford replacements.
Edgar is taking English, philosophy, art history, and one course titled "The Intersectionality of Harry Potter". He intends to have a master's degree in gender studies. He sees himself as socially "woke" and wants to either join Greenpeace or be a Title IX administrator - he's not sure which.

You all see where I'm going with this. We can argue whether Alice or Bob is going to save more lives in the long run (we clearly need both), and we can debate whether Charlie is going to get anywhere doing what he's doing or if Deborah's incremental approach will cause less fossil fuel to be burned. But Edgar isn't even in the running. He's not saving lives. He's not going to prevent discrimination or stop fossil fuel companies or whatever. He's not helping the world. His degree is going to be in screeching. His daily life is also likely taken up by screeching. No matter how many Twitter or Reddit posts he makes about Russia or Trump or whatever, he has not helped a single person of any color or creed, not even himself.

So, my message to first-year college students is this:

Walk away, right now, before you end up like Edgar. A Very Special Message for First-Year College Students
dd525 So I was on Tim Pool youtube page and I saw this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL54ib4-fJA. The video talks about why men are refusing to work with women in the metoo era. The biggest reason given was that many man where scared that a compliment would lead to them being accussed of sexual harassment. 
This a long with the hypocrisies of Rose Mcowan and Asia argento have turned some people off to metoo. So has the metoo movement kind of cooled off? Has the metoo movement destroyed itself?
kaazsssz For me it was a bit of a process. I was a major SJW, I know all the facts! I had taken so many sociology classes and had written so many great papers for college, whew! I was the shit! 

I started taking basic economics, macro and micro, for the purpose of proving those evil right wingers wrong (I had sjw Econ professors.) 

But one day, in my macro textbook I read some interesting facts. It wasn’t a biased fact, it was simply a fact about some numbers. I’m not sure what exactly is said now, this was like 6 or more years ago (only in the past year have I left the left). Basically the book stated something about businesses and government lobbying. Businesses did x percentage of government lobbying. I was like “aha! The evil capitalists! They control the government with their lobbying!” 

And so I went digging. I learned that businesses would lobby the government for environmental regulations, or safety regulations, or who knows what. Why would they do that? They cut out their own money to have these regulations. What I soon found out was that these regulations cut out their competition. That once a corporation was large enough, it could lobby the government, and create a situation where any startup competitor would never be able to start a business due to huge price floors, such as having to meet a safety standard that costs insane amounts of money not only to meet, but to pay the government to even get a license.

My mind wasn’t changed yet but I was curious. These evil corporations were controlling the government, I always knew that as an sjw. I knew the evil capitalists were always plotting. And so I went on with school, taking as much sociology as I could (without it being a major because I loved physics).

I started doing research on socialism and communism. I thought the world needed a revolution. And I was set on proving those people who believe in capitalism wrong.

In my mind, inequality was the result of racism. Why would black and Hispanic people live at double the rate per percentage of their population than white people? What explanation was there for it? Either the system was systematically racist (the truth in my eyes) or you believed it was due to genetics and thus you were a racist. All of my sociology learning confirmed it was racism. All of my socialism and communism research confirmed it was the evil capitalists, and some racism. Why didn’t capitalists understand that the system was rigged for non whites? They must be racist, they must really believe that blacks and Hispanics are inferior to whites! Those sick fucks!

And so I was on a mission to learn all I could. I started to learn more about economics but always from the left perspective.

Then one day I came across a video that said “why the minimum wage is bad” with Peter Schiff. I scoffed as I always did “this will be another bunch of racist trash” I used to watch right wing videos and wait till I heard some racist shit, and I’d say “typical” and shut it off. I didn’t need to hear any more.

But Peter Schiff, he didn’t trigger my racist button that the left installed in me. So I ended up watching the whole video. He showed how just like with corporate lobbying to destroy competition, that government interference and regulations helped to hurt the very people it was supposed to help. The people I cared about the most, the poor, were being hurt by a whole myriad of of government legislation. He explained it in a way that I was actually able to open up my eyes and mind to. 

That day all of the little things I had learned here and there all came together and boom, I was enlightened. My perspective was forever changed.

I adopted an entrepreneurial mindset. I had been watching my favorite youtubers working hard, making videos, selling t-shirts. Offering life advice like “work hard and your dreams can come true too!” I never really understood exactly how it was possible, at least not without government help. Until I saw that Peter schiff video. Suddenly I saw that yes, I could create my own life. I could work hard and follow my passions and help people and make money and make a great life for myself. I didn’t have to wallow in despair at how the system is rigged against poor people and there’s no way out! No, that’s idiotic. Any person can conquer poverty. It’s all in your mindset. Every individual can make something of their life. The government doesn’t save us poor people. It hurts us. It removes our ability to create our own life. It puts regulations in the way and justifies them because we really believe all people are inherently evil and just searching to make a quick buck at the expense of the lives of other people. It’s a sick mentality and while in some cases it’s true, government intervention in the economy only exacerbates this part of human nature. 

Now here I am, taking my perspective now and comparing it as much as I can to my former views. Reading what leftists have to say, socialist and all that. Now I can really dig as deep as I want into their views and it only seems to solidify what I’ve learned. I can see their ignorance so clearly but it’s impossible to show them my new perspective. It’s all about perspective. There’s nothing wrong with inequality. There’s something seriously sick and twisted about telling people they are hopeless in this world. Telling women and minorities that they can’t do it without government help because the evil white men are working hard to keep them down! Yea they are, it’s YOU, you leftists with your self defeating messages. Leftists destroy the hearts and minds of people. They remove our free will and make us believe everything is determined from birth. It’s an insidious disease one that the leftists just don’t understand. They don’t see how their views degrade the hearts and minds and free will and happiness of the people.

Then I found Jordan Peterson and he confirms all of this. But to them, he’s telling lies and misconstrued the facts. But see, he’s right. The left is a foul disease robbing humanity of their free will.

Now I’m on the Ayn Rand train. Objectivism is an amazing thing. It’s the most positive inspiring ideology I’ve ever learned about. But if you’re a leftist it’s pure evil.

Perspective is funny. No amount of facts and statistics seem able to change a perspective. It’s a bit of willingness to open your mind and a bit of a slow process to get the ball rolling. And once you finally wake up, it doesn’t hurt. It feels good. It feels good to continuously orient yourself towards the truth, for the truth shall set you free.  My journey to walking away
BunnyGandhi So one thing that has been bothering me for ages is that in spite of my strong dislike for the way the left is developing, it's extremely hard to find "a home". 

I'm from Germany so my reality is ever so slighty different from yours when it comes to certain topics, but at heart I believe the main reasons for people to turn away from the left to be

1. Lack of critical thinking (lots of directly contradictory ideas)
2. Condoning and actively pushing fascist practices like for example censorship, persecution of people of differing [political] oppinions (think Twitter shitstorms to get people fired), refusing any debate on hot topics and others

But for some reason there never seems to be a moderate alternative, one that does not bite it's own tail in the fight against these anti democratic, anti rational and anti freedom ideas. 
For example in Germany we have two political parties that are not part of what I would consider the problematic left. Both right wing and both condoning or actively pushing to right wing fascism (the AFD being way more moderate than the NPD, but both absolutely not standing for my values). 

And this is something that's fundamentally bothering me. Whenever there is a movement that critizises the regressive left, right wing fascists who think they found a platform to spew their own bullshit immediately try to undermine it. Because the enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?

Wrong, I'm not friends with fascists. If I were, I could stick with the regressive left. Fascists are my enemy no matter whether they come from the left or right and I am here because I am sick of their bullshit.



What anti regressive left movements often fail to do and what ultimately leads to their fall, is to fight these tendencies.

If we want to be taken seriously and not end up being just another "Alt Right fascist home" we need to make sure these idiots find no nourishing grounds. Downvote and report any right wing propaganda (the word propaganda being key here). And the moderators need to take their job seriously and moderate the shit out of people trying to spread this shit.

This does explicitly NOT mean that we cannot openly discuss issues, but this bullshit here: https://www.reddit.com/r/walkaway/comments/9iz3ad/leftist_dance_around_the_fire/ is nothing short of propaganda. It clearly mourns the fight against propagandist bullshit like infowars and unscientifical conspiracy theories like the anti vaxer movement. And it resonates well with this sub (see upvotes, 28 when I first saw the thread), people just upvote it, no discussion about it. Great critical thinking. Wow. I'm appaled. Moreso because I know the guy who made the thread who I hope didn't intend to spread propaganda but failed to critically analyze the picture before posting it here.


If this is how this movement will go - undermined by radical right wingers, propagandists and conspiracy theorists, I will be walking away from this quicker than I walked away from the regressive left.


Now this is the first thing like this I've seen here (relatively new, Hi!) but it seems like people are willing to gobble it up. It has me worried. It's not a trend yet, but if we condone shit like this, this is just gonna turn into another platform for fascists. 



I urge you to fight such tendencies. Both the moderators and the users. Anti regressive left movements and ring wing extremists
GeneralElement Hi, newish here. Mostly ever a lurker. Have a 'walkaway' story, but, don't find it compelling enough to tell. In regards to this title, however, I hope it's the right place to post it. 

I've been following r/politics for some time now and it seems that every news post posted lately is left-sided. And if the article that is posted isn't, the comments on it certainly are. Overwhelmingly so. The comments on almost all posts on r/politics fall right into the rhetoric that r/walkaway and right-leaning subreddits specifically hate. Irrational opinions about topics that are either completely fabricated or misunderstood. 

Am I the only one that sees this? Or am I just subconsciously looking for it and finding it due to my political views?  Am I the only one that sees r/politics as extremely left-sided?
Y10NRDY Hey guys, classical liberal/slightly right-of-center libertarian here. I was pushed from the party immediately preceding the walkaway movement. A combination of Clinton/DNC corruption, PC culture’s mounting attacks on free speech and general Orwellian vibe that the Left and Big Tech started giving off and  Obama’s utter failure as a president sorta pooled and the bullshit was too thick to ignore at that point.

So, Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings come on and I’m watching and I’m seeing the Linda Sarsours and sjw freakshow get dragged out one-by-one and I’m like that’s fine. Free Speech.

Then the hail mary with Ford drops and it’s a clear political move by Feinstein but FINE go ahead and clear the air, whatever. This guy’s a traditional conservative. Already given his disposition on R v. W as precedent so no real threat to the status quo.

Then the second one.

And now the fucking *gang rape* allegations. You read the fine print and it’s like this is clearly bullshit. And they know it and don’t care because apparently all their dignity and reputation mean shit compared to cock-blocking Trump’s justice pick.

And I can’t help but wonder. *What are the sensible-minded JFK kinda normal boomer Democrats thinking of this?* Some of ‘em have to be low key *this is fucked up* but they’re all going to play along because fuck Trump.

Usually I am all for some petty shit but what is going on here? Effect of Kavanaugh Allegations on Free-Thinkers

moondoge92 Hi friends, recently walked away in the past year and half. (Sanders donor to card carrying Republican). I got off of social media because well, it's terrible for my mental health. 

I've heard there's a huge shift in momentum from the Senate hearings, but I don't know what the reaction is outside of my own circles or a brainwashed forum or college classroom. What has been your moderate or otherwise unbiased friend's reactions to the hearings? Have you seen any friends #walkaway after listening to the Kavanaugh hearings?
myg0dd It doesn't matter if it's family, friends, or a stranger.. If they are a leftist, they support: 

* Fake rape allegations

* The elimination of basic constitutional rights like owning firearms, or due process

* Transgender therapy for children, pre-pubescent cross dressers and transsexuals 

* The elimination of masculinity and fatherhood, the degradation of basic nuclear families 

* Female casualties of war, despite the overwhelming proof that all male units are by far the most efficient at carrying out missions 

* Censorship. It goes without saying that the left wants to control what you think, hear, see, watch, etc. The massive banning and quarantining of subreddits is proof 

* Culture warfare. The left thrives off racism, open borders, and civil unrest. Dismantling traditionalism and replacing it with chaos is their goal as long as they can extract cash and power from the overwhelmed masses.

If you know or meet anyone that is a leftist, just know that they are an active piece of shit that is trying to ruin your individual freedom or family, or a totally ignorant piece of shit that needs to be slapped.  Daily reminder, leftists deserve 0 attention, and 0 respect..
r3df0x_556 I'm not a conservative because I'm too redpilled for that, but I understand why people are becoming conservative because of how regressive the quasi marxist left has become.  The regressive left is a lot like Louis XVI or the Tsar in 1917.  Hopefully we won't ruin our country with 70 years of thinking the free market can regulate itself.

Right now I self identify as a Roosevelt Republican or "alt-left," which I consider separate from the regressive left or "alt liberals" who I consider the South Park libertarian types.

I first had a redpill moment after college and became a borderline SJW.  Conservatives seem to think that racism and sexism magically ended in the 90s and they should just throw their hands up over the few assholes left and let the free market sort it out.  Unrestricted capitalism doesn't work because of human nature and it flies in the face of Christianity.  For it to work, you have to believe that man is good when man is a sinner who has temptation for greed.

I started dating online and I was completely repulsive to women whereas I never really had much issue with dating in college.  I started dating liberal feminist girls and either got rejected or exploited.  I was a huge fan of Big Bang Theory at this time.  I think it's ok now and don't hate it but it's not great.

Three things happened around the time I ended up coming out of my SJW mindset.  I met an Irish American girl online, ironically I bought a Mosin and my sister also admitted to being a girl.  She's still an anti SJW but that whole experience made me look into the regressive left even more.  Buying a Mosin connected me with IraqVeteran8888 videos on Youtube and my whole mindset started to change.  I already had guilt over marxism and knew that it was really an impossible ideal.  I ended up coming back to the culture I had admired and started a process of abandoning the marxist and SJW mindset.  Seeing all the hate from the regressive left helped.  I realize that I self identify (Not in a Tumblr way.) as a Roosevelt progressive.  I want to be able to live in the libertarian utopia where everyone lives on a ranch with no interference from the government, but that's as unrealistic as a communist utopia, which is technically also libertarian.

I'm not sure whose side I'm going to be on yet, but I'm going to pick one and not be a limp dick centrist.

One of the things that really turned me away from the regressive left was how wimpy they were.  Marxists defeated the real nazis and these soyboy incels are throwing tantrums over Trump.  Teddy Roosevelt was a progressive and now we have all these "progressive" male creepy incel soyboys that have been told their entire lives that masculinity is toxic and it's ok for them to be a limp wristed beta male. A very brief walk away experience (sort of)
stockphotoframe Both sides are so gross to me right now. The Kavanaugh/Ford circus is bringing out some nasty comments from EVERYONE.

I kinda ran to t_d when I initially gave up on the left. The energy and patriotism feels good there. I love America! But oh boy are there some incredibly misogynistic comments there surrouding Dr. Ford. Huge, gross generalizations of all women being liars and worse. Multiple highly upvoted posts saying "I will NEVER believe another rape accusation"

Uh....?

I was initially pretty skeptical of the Ford accusation, but I've come to see her as a pawn of the Democrats and I feel pretty bad for her. It sounds like she really did not want this all to come back to her and be in the spotlight but Feinstein's team or *someone* leaked her info. 

Those on the right saying "why didn't she report it?!" Or "how does she not remember every detail?!" I mean, why would she go to the cops over attempted groping. What would you really report there? And I can understand if she worried about social ostracization over coming out with something like that.

I partied pretty hard in highschool and college. For me it's about 16-17 years ago. There is NO WAY I could tell you the details of every party I was at, who was there, where we were. I've fortunately never been sexually assaulted but I can recall several attempts of boys going a little further than I'd like. It happened the first time I was drunk, I was 17 and this guy was on top of me. He was in college and me and a few other girlfriends were at his, or someone's (?) apartment. I'm blurry on who exactly was there or where we were other than the city we were in. Actually, I'm not even sure on that! The guy got off of me so maybe if it was more traumatic I'd remember more. I didn't tell any of the girls because I was a little embarrassed about it. But thinking on all the parties I've been to I could not recall much about them. Alcohol does that to you.

So I do not think any of this is far fetched. That said, I don't think EVEN IF it were true it would warrant the character assassination on BK we've seen from the left. Drunk highschool boys get a little handsy, but that is worlds away from penetrative rape. The left has diluted the terms 'rape' and 'sexual assault' so much that we see posts on t_d like the ones I mentioned above where no woman will ever be believed again, despite the very real problem of actual rape. They're acting like it never happens, FFS.

Idk. My partying days are over. I'm a suburban housewife with a few young kids of each gender and it's scary raising boys OR girls. Call me crazy but there are good and bad men and women. People get drunk and make mistakes, especially high schoolers. I'm not remotely the same person I was at 17, I don't think anyone is.

That's all, I needed to get this out and I don't know where a general, kind of neutral discussion oriented political sub exists. Walked away, but not sure where to. There is no party for women.
MrMattrg Ford's testimony seemed at least a bit more credible than Kavanaugh's Let's see how fast I can get banned from here
BadNerfAgent I know reddit's /r/politics is a completely bias sub. However, I thought it was mostly from just sheep which go there that upvote content and comment.

However, I've stumbled across something that seems far more insideous. I've noticed that if I comment on /r/labour, a UK british political party sub (the UK version of the democrat party), I am not able to post on /r/politics for 8 minutes. This to me reeks of unethical behaviour on behalf of reddits mods or staff. It proves a defeat sub is linked to a political party, which in my view is unacceptable.

Fwiw, I'm allow to post on /r/tory, the UK's republican counterpart.

Now I'm quite a debater on these subs, and I'm wondering if they've just done this for me. Or if this is a site wide thing. So could you make a discreet post on both /r/labour and /r/politics and see if posting on one place has given you a time limit on the other. Can you do this experiment for me?
petitereddit We can't encourage people to walk away, and not meet them half way with open arms and  When people walk away, who is there to meet and greet them? It can be a difficult time when your paradigm shifts and I'm wondering if people are getting the support they need and what things they can be empowered to do.
Fenrir_24 I know you all are pissed Hillary stole the candidacy.  Are you also mad that Berine is now towing the party line on Kavanaugh?  I typically don't post here because it's for former Democrats, not me.  But if I ask this somewhere like politics I'll just get downvoted with no answers offered.  Thanks folks.  Honest question for the Bernie voters about the current circus.
myg0dd Kanye West is the perfect example. Healthy, successful, happy black father and what do leftist do to him? Ridicule, hate, lecture, and attempt to control. They don't want Kanye to be a happy black man, he's got to get his black ass down to the BLM protests to burn another city down. He's got to be like Kolin Kappernick and hate cops despite the fact that black on black violence has killed millions in a few decades, more than a coalition of KKK members *could ever dream of.*  Liberals and Democrats alike **do not want to end racism or sexism.** They *need* it for sustenance
norris2017 It is a very dangerous time when so many blatantly false accusations can be made, and the accussed is "guilty" until proven innocent, instead of the other way around.  What are the thoughts of people walking away from the Democrats on this? So has the circus of the last two weeks caused anyone to say enough?
WadeTrillson Let me start this off saying I think anyone who's sexually assaulted someone needs to be buried under the jail. However, it is dangerous as absolute fuck the way people are handling sexual assault allegations nowadays. In certain circumstances I can understand and excuse holding back from coming forward for a few years or even decades out of fear (ie. people admitting to being molested in church simply because they were victimized by someone in a position of authority who was backed by a massively powerful entity that is established religion). But even counting the report of Ford mentioning this party back in 2012, the Dems had this information months ago and didn't do SHIT with it. Sat in the same room with the guy and didn't bat an eye. You got Retardacus Booker saying he'll break senate rules by releasing emails but nobody thought to address the claims of sexual assault allegations until after they ran out of other stall tactics. The only thing worse than sexual assault is a snake-like scumbag who uses it as a opportunistic weapon for their own gain. Why are they only using this to prevent Kavanaugh from a government position? How is that noble? If they really gave a flying fuck about victims of sexual assault this would be getting pressed in criminal court. If the only goal of claiming someone as a sexual predator is to cost them their job it is nothing more than a smear campaign. That's not justice. I've seen people visibly pissed when Cosby got sentenced saying 'how can come out with rape accusations from decades ago' but now they are on high horses saying 'believe her' and calling Kavanaugh a rapist when there is even less evidence against him than there was against Cosby. I never thought I'd see the day where rape allegations became a political weapon thats held closely to the chest and unleashed strategically like a Pokeball. And I never thought I'd see the day where the party that's supposed to be for women's rights would used women's plight as a sloppy rallying call. (end rant) [Rant] I already walked away but this Kavanaugh circus makes me want to burn bridges
The-Plauge-Dragon It seems that the most conservative Presidents in recent history (Reagan and Trump) have been former democrats who decided to walk away from the Democrats. I’m looking at this movement and I wonder if there are any future presidents in it... I’ve noticed something
JohnnyJMcIvorV The evangelicals at r/AgainstHateSubreddits have been working with the mods to ban right wing subs, expect this place to be temporary. If you don't believe me, they're going after UnpopularOpinions now Heads up: your sub will probably be banned
BaptizedNRG I used to be a Democrat until I found out they are just as dedicated to the preservation of the ruling class and American Empire as the Republicans are. That's why I left and became a Socialist. Don't be a pawn of either side. Fight for the working class! #Walkaway to Leftism
SexyImposter Greetings from a former (and somewhat embarrassed to admit it) liberal who I guess you can say finally saw "the light" and realized how much BS I was being fed by the establishment politicians and democrats in this country.

As background I'm a black guy who used to see the right wing with noting but fear and contempt, but let's just say this Kavanaugh disaster has been the final straw for me. Hell, I even canvassed for Bernie during the 2016 primaries. Over the past two years however I have seen nothing but hate and vitriol expended needlessly by my former liberal "friends" and it has been overwhelming and tbh a bit disgusting. The complete lack of foresight or deep thinking on the left in America left me feeling homeless and without hope until I realized that they were the ones fighting against a better America all along.

Seeing how they viciously harassed Kavanaugh, the #metoo campaign and its use of baseless accusations to destroy the livelihood of some good men, I now understand they are using emotions and manipulation to try and maintain power. I've done my research and realized I actually support a lot of Trump's policies (not all, but a lot) and it has opened my eyes so much. Count me in for 2018, patriots, I'm here to join in the party to make America truly great again! The way they treated Kavanaugh was the final straw for me.
Fuck_Mtn Would love to be able to see where the dumb fucks come from. Mods: can we add automod to show us when someone links to a post here to brigade us?
Msmith68w Since 2016, I've gone from someone who voted for Bernie, and not a single Republican candidate, to someone who intends to vote straight ticket Republican in the midterms, and I don't feel that I've personally changed that much. It's been a really wild ride, and I had no idea there were thousands of you doing the same. 

&amp;#x200B;

For me personally, this was all set in motion by the Parkland shooting. As someone with experience in the military, a working knowledge of firearms, and I job in academic research, I saw the blatant mis-representation of the social science data we have surrounding guns. I saw the way it was tailored, picked, and pruned to fit a narrative. Seeing this occur on what I had considered to be "objective" new sources (NYT, ABC, NBC, CBS, Vox, etc) just left a splinter in my mind that I couldn't ignore.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I started to wonder "If they'll misrepresent this data to fit this narrative, what else are they manipulating" and the walls just started crumbling down. The gender pay gap, diversity/inclusion, minority oppression, the patriarchy, global politics, Trump, conservatives, etc etc etc. I went one by one and was able to now see the way I'd been misled and conditioned. I spent 7 years in higher education at a state university, and I do not believe that colleges are intentionally indoctrinating students into liberal ideology...but I do think they're doing it accidentally. The overwhelming liberal majority among professors and administrators is staggering, and I witnessed first hand how that bleeds into the zeitgeist of opinion on campus. I believe that many, if not most, academics try to prevent their own biases and political views from influencing their students. They try to choose their words carefully, but they simply can't escape their worldview. These authority figures unknowingly present a paradigm that young, malleable brains absorb and internalize. Sprinkle in a few far leftist activist professors who think it's their job to organize protests and the like, and you have a liberal supermajority forming among students. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly embarrassed at the way I treated some of the conservatives in my life in previous years (my family mostly). I jumped to the worst conclusions about them when we disagreed on political issues, I assumed their ignorance, or I thought they were being indoctrinated by Fox News. Little did I know that they were much wiser that I, and I am thankful that they were patient and loving enough to absorb my disdain and keep coming back for more. As a part of my political evolution, these wounds have been healed and I'm grateful for that.  

&amp;#x200B;

It feels good to call myself a conservative. It felt very foreign for some time, but today I can say that I am proud of my ability to resist groupthink and group identity. I have my values and political opinions as a result of deliberate, thoughtful investigation, rather than by default(following family or peers), and that carries me through the storms of criticism (of which there have been many by my peers). The way that seemingly intelligent people have turned on me and my views in such hateful and disrespectful ways is more telling than anything else. The "Tolerant" left, exposing themselves for who they really are...tolerant of those who agree with them and intolerant of everyone else. I will proudly walk away from such a group. Holy Cow, I Didn't Know There Were Others Like Me
caseycityhall I still am but I used to be too. This sub is trash I used to be a Democrat...
Happy1911 For 23 years I use to volunteer for liberals , but in 2007 , what you see that they are doing to Judge Kavanaugh, well they did that to me and I had nobody that would help me . So I could not Walk Away . Instead I took my knowledge of the laws and followed the money, attacking them every place I could find corruption , having there programs shut down just as BHO stated in that long boring speech two week ago . For 7 1/2 years now I have been getting there crimes exposed. All the Global Warming crap , Trillion of Dollars stolen, yes it is I . I am The Turd ! Don’t just walk , RUN !  I Use to Volunteer for Democrats
gfaud I am having a hard time posting this but watch, if you have it, Evan Sayet: A Deplorable Mind on Amazon. It helped me turn Those on the fence
grafxbill https://www.pcc.edu/illumination/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2018/05/power-nonpower-chart-institutional-oppression-exercise.pdf

I'm sure this is pretty common nowadays, but it was eye-opening for me because I graduated over 10 years ago, to see a live link of class material which instructs indoctrination of students at the collegiate level. 

It is a paper on "Anti-Oppression Theory" which claims to "allow participants to explore the inequities of power that exist in the U.S.".

It makes me sick to see this level of indoctrination at a collegiate level, especially at a public, taxpayer-funded university.

What do you all think? A live link to the indoctrination of public universities (Portland Community College)
gfaud Im not a walkaway type, or at least one recently. However, this guy was one after 9/11. This was the talk he gave for the Heritage Foundation in 2007 that helped me and my family realize the changing of liberals to leftists. He also has a funny talk on Amazon Prime called A Deplorable Mind. I think the last ten minutes or so is the outlook we should be taking. I encourage all with access to watch it, I can’t link it here, but please adopt a Democrat If you have the opportunity. Thanks.

https://i.redd.it/wy1kly2zxcq11.gif Celebrate with Justice Kavanaugh!!! #WalkAway Today!!!
BrighterDawn2121 I never expected to be writing this.

I was a Democrat from 18-28, always voted Dem, no matter what. I’m gay and live in NYC. My whole family is Democrats. All my friends and almost all my co-workers are Democrats. I went to an elite east coast school where everyone was a Democrat.

I voted for Obama. I voted for Hillary in 2016. Not only that, I HATED Trump and his supporters. I thought they were racist, dumb and as Hillary said “deplorable.” I’ll admit I did have my differences with Democrats on some stuff. I didn’t like political correctness or liberal fondness for Islamic fundamentalism. I didn’t totally agree with their immigration policy or BLM/anti-police stance. I didn’t like the rising Far-Left movements on my side. But, I basically just wrote all of that off. I still absolutely hated Trump in 2016.

Then, he was actually elected. I’ve seen the Left go completely insane and I’ve seen Trump become the most successful President in modern history. It’s been eating away at me over time, maybe I was wrong about this whole thing. I feel like the past two years, the Left has been on a mission to convince me they’re completely insane and frankly anti-American. Meanwhile Trump is succeeding beyond any expert’s expectation…

All of this came to a head with Kavanaugh. I saw a public witch hunt with the full participation of every level of Democrats, from the moderates to the Left. They just don’t want anything to succeed they want to obstruct and destroy. I’ve had enough… So, officially, I’m joining #WalkAway. I’m voting all Republican in the midterms. I’m so excited to vote for Trump in 2020! I’m just going to admit, I was wrong about Trump. It pains me a bit, but I actually like him, he’s doing an amazing job. The people who I derided as “deplorables,” they were 100% right and I was wrong. I’m still not going to tell my friends or family because they’re all viciously anti-Trump and it’s basically illegal in the gay community here, but I’m now a STRONG supporter of our President.

Personally, I think this movement is bigger than anyone imagines. If strong Democrats who hated Trump are coming around like me, people on the fence are really going to be switching. It’s a taboo in some places, but we’re the silent majority. Trump isn’t going to win 2020 by a little, it’s going to be an epic landslide. My #WalkAway story
PitoStinko 2 terms

Get out and vote for midterms y’all! Gg ez
GreatDay4Hockey As recently as 2016, you would have never caught me voting for a Republican. I volunteered for Hillary's campaign that year and was devastated the night Trump won. Not to the point of hysterical meltdown or anything, but I honestly believed this was the worst thing that could have happened for the country.

Almost two years later, and now having watched the Kavanaugh circus with millions of people, I have come around and become more moderate. I couldn't believe the way he was dragged through the mud by the Democrats and how they all seemed to be so sure HE was lying. I work in the legal field. Respected, federal judges just do not lie under oath knowing they will be charged with perjury. A judge with an impeccable record who is emotional because he is being falsely accused of a hideous crime should not be disqualified from serving on the Supreme Court. Why is that he needs to just sit there and take it? So are the Democrats saying that if they are falsely accused of a crime they will just be like oh OK let me remain totally chill and go about my day? 

Dr. Ford is a complete joke. What kind of victim says she asked her "beach friends" for their opinion on whether she should call a lawyer? How is she so sure Kavanaugh did it yet keeps changing her story otherwise and can't seem to recall all of these traumatizing details? I had serious questions after watching that hearing. But most of my friends were blindlessly parroting the "believe all women" mantra and making posts about how horrible this nomination was for women and saying that the government believes women don't matter.

I posted my thoughts on Kavanaugh and also came out as a pro-lifer. I have since lost three friends, one of who told me that I am not the person she thought I was. Ironically, this woman calls herself Christian and writes almost a paragraph long Facebook post every Sunday about how she can't wait to attend church and hear the sermon. I challenged another and asked her TWICE if she watched the hearings, and she couldn't even answer the question. I'm sad these people would unfriend me because I don't see Kavanaugh as a rapist or a dangerous alcoholic. Why are they allowed to speak freely on their stance and I cannot? 

What made me confident in my decision today was the totally inappropriate outbursts in the Senate gallery by the far left protestors. Since when is screaming like a banshee and having a hysterical meltdown the way to get politicians to listen to you? These nutjobs would be thrown out of a county courthouse if they acted like that. I'd ignore them too if I were a Republican Senator because they are incapable of mature, reasonable conversation. Women want to be strong and be heard and yet their response to not getting what they want is flailing around, screaming incoherently and sobbing in front of a Senator on his way to do his job. 

For the record, I am a woman. And I do not hang on to the woe is me stance the way the far left does. I'm glad other women--even survivors of assault--support Kavanaugh and see Christine Ford for who she really is. 

&amp;#x200B; I have already lost three "friends" because I decided to #walkaway
cajunofthe9th Hey guys, new here. I'm a registered Democrat but this thing red pilled me. It's like waking up from a trance and looking at all the former shows and news I enjoyed and watched and seeing it with a brand new eyes and hearing it for what it really is, a load of bull shit. I can see now how the MSM are full of one sided crap and an echo chamber, in which we were constantly repeating the leftist mantra of tolerance and freedom whilst acting the exact opposite. I used to see a conservative person as a backward gun toting hick with little to no education because that's what is being portrayed in the media and I just accepted it. 

The Dems overplayed this thing, trying to destroy a pretty decent guy for political gain, and the worst thing they could find about this guy is that he drank during high school and he threw an ice cube at a bar, including a barrage of accusations without and substance or evidence. This is what got me and I believe a lot more like me. That they can fuck a man's life, one who has stellar record and a family man, that easily. That guy is a GOOD guy, and look at the damage they've done. What do you think the narrative is going to be if Kavanaugh didn't go through, that they can destroy a good man's life just because it is to their benefit. What does that say to you and me whom I can argue with high confidence that has way way worse record than a supreme Court judge.

All I can say is to forgive those protestors, they don't know what they are doing, they really don't. All the MSM and college campuses are almost entirely spouting liberal agenda. It is run by emotions, not facts, and we were taught that emotions are enough, that if we felt deep inside that we were wronged then that is right, facts be damned. 

I hope I'm not alone on this one, as this emotionally driven idiocy has to stop. I guess this is the time I #walkaway.

Nice to meet you guys, glad to be finally here.

 Registered Democrat here
tiny_philosopher For the past 49 years, I've been a bible thumpin, gun totin, abortion hatin, minority intoleratin, nascar watchin, moonshine drinkin, cheeseburger eatin conservative.

Last week I was watching the Kavanaugh hearings and I was so upset. How could these libtards treat such an honorable lovely emotional man like this? I was so angry that I decided to take out some frustration. I head to my room to take a Viagra and masturbate to some Anime porno.

But suddenly I realized that the blue pill I had just taken was not a Viagra. It was something entirely different. Suddenly this feeling washed over me. My head was buzzing, my vision clearer. I had this urge to research. So I Xed out of hentaihaven.org, RT, and Gateway Pundit. I pulled up Google to see what the rest of the world was sayin about reality.

I couldn't believe what I was seein. I started realizin that maybe Trump wasn't hand picked by Jesus to save the world from liberal satanic pedophiles. Maybe the reason people don't like him is because he's kind of a dick to everybody and he doesn't seem to know what he's doin in the job.

I researched for hours. Eventually I had to take a break. I looked down at my firearm collection of 30 AR-15s and for a second I thought, maybe I don't actually need all these. For the first time in my life, I decided to visit the Starbucks down the street. This pill had me feelin adventurous, so I ordered an upside down half-caff soy latte. And you know what? It was pretty darn good.

As I headed home, I passed three young men in a park. One of them said "hey bro, wanna hit this joint?" Now I have never been under the influence of drugs. I've done my fair share of opioids, meth and grain alchohol, but I'm not some kind of drug user. Still feeling adventurous, I decided to try this marijuana. And you know what? It was pretty darn good. And so was the frisbee we played for the next hour and a half.

So here I am. My eyes have opened. Everything I believed my whole life has been wrong. I'm here to tell you that this former die hard conservative will be voting an all blue ticket this November. Thanks for lettin me share.

 My story of walking away after the kavanaugh circus
StealthModeWalking So this is a copy/paste of the post that got me banned from r/liberal. When I contacted the moderators to request an explanation of rules that I had broken I was muted and ignored. Please read and share.




Hello everyone. My name is Mike and I am a registered Democrat and have never in my life voted for a Republican candidate. I am an native American, am bisexual, married to a black woman, have 2 kids, and spent 8 years in the Marines working in the field of counter intelligence. Even though doxxing is against the rules, if you were to do so you would see that I have stated these things repeatedly and started this account a month ago or so because I wanted a fresh start because I realized that I, as a liberal, was unwittingly contributing to supporting child grooming and pedophile rights. I agreed with a lot of liberal ideas and values but this was the one that made me say enough, I can't do this, and re-evaluate what politics meant to me and what my values really were. 

The very first thing I did was something I never thought I would do. After months of trolling and attacking random people in the walkaway sub I did real research into it and realized that even though russian bots had tampered with the movement there were hundreds of thousands of real people attached to it, nearly a million actually, and it clicked. I went to the sub and announced I was joining the ranks. As predicted I was called a fake, a russian bot, etc. and the irony was amazing. I went back to posting in r/politics with the intention of trying to help others like myself wake up and see the corruption that they were contributing to and that the things that made them hate the Republican party and Trump administration were lies concoted by our Democratic leaders controlling the MSM which Nancy Pelosi told us they were doing last year, we just didn't listen. During this process I was called a racist, a bigot, a nazi, a russian, a bot, several racial slurs, a misogynist, a rapist, a rape apologist, and recieved private messages with death threats from liberals. Simaltaneously I was invited with open arms and accepted by Republicans even though I didn't agree with them on many topics and not once did I get called any type of nasty anything. This was the eye opener that made me realize that we, as Democrats and liberals, were the problem in this country, and after watching the Kavanaugh circus and the tens of thousands who have walked away because of it I know it was the right decision.

I know that one of 3 things is going to happen by posting this. Either A) I will be called a troll and banned, even though it's not true at all. B) I will be insulted and downvoted into oblivion which is the standard protocol we are taught to do to people we don't agree with. Or C) At least a few people who have been seeing the lies and hypocrisey will read this and realize that doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result is insanity (which is why they call us the crazy left) and realize that the only way to effectively take down the people and policies we don't agree with is to join the winning team and effect change from within. In any of these scenarios it proves my case to be true and I hope to have you all join me in my cause to reunite our country. No more blue or red, no more violence and hate, we never stood for those things and we shouldn't start now. No more division. No more victims. Let's go purple and never look back. The post that got me banned from the liberal sub
AlphaTenken Anyone have a compendium of sources?

To show good Trump has done?

To show Trump is not xx? Best Sources To Convince Others?
Orbtecc So, she accuses Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, and even testifies in front of the Senate, but [lets everything go the moment he gets confirmed](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/christine-blasey-ford-wants-to-move-on/)?  Seems legit.  I'm shocked that more people aren't talking about this.  The FBI had to waste time and resources to investigate the guy, because the Democrats wouldn't stop crying.  Those same Democrats ruined Kavanaugh's public image, and put his family in danger.  Now, Ford's gonna laugh all the way to the bank, with the [$583,400 she got off of GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/help-christine-blasey-ford).  Jesus fucking Christ. Let's Talk About how Christine Blasey Ford Suddenly Doesn't Wanna Pursue her Allegations for Sexual Assault
SexyImposter Former boomer conservatism and fundie Christianity living with my parents, to moderately leftwing atheist for the first year on my own, but something didn't quite feel right.

Then I got really into politics I remember my watershed #RedPillMoment when I thought, I'll give this video with "racist bigot" Faith Goldy and Gavin McInnes a chance expecting it to be really repulsive like the traditional right I was used to. But it wasn't, it was surprisingly reasonable and well-humoured, "the enemy" wasn't nearly as bad as I thought and from their I've taken more red pills and I'm happy to call myself a rightwing atheist.

So when was my redpill? I voted Bernie in the primary, knew I would never support Hillary for ANY reason! After seeing Bernie kiss the ring and start supporting Hillary and her corruption I literally became ill. My vote for Trump was a FU to Hillary. I wasn't fully on board with MAGA yet but knew I didn't want Hillary.

I am officially walking away. I might even do a video since I know that people like me will see this and call me a "russian bot, because I have done so in the past. Again, I apologize. I have seen the light. I have taken the first step to walk away from the party that has betrayed America time and time again.
mynameisntThrombo Lifelong Democrat here, and sorry in advance for the rant but I've got to say something and this really feels like the place. I was browsing r/all yesterday and came across a post from r/the-mueller that was something along the lines of "new GOP banner out, get your stickers printed today" and I just had it. If you haven't seen it, it depicted the GOP elephant with it's trunk up a woman's skirt, and the woman yelling for help.

I don't know why this post bothered me so much. Maybe it was the disgusting content. Maybe it was the swarm of people laughing about how great it was and how they "can't wait to put the stickers on police cars", but I commented that I'd finally had it with the negativity and perversion. Every post on every left leaning sub is negative or vulgar. Every comment, every response, every private message I've gotten. It's all negative. People called me a fake Democrat, a troll, a Russian bot... And I'm just like, "guys wtf happened to this party?". Nothing I say could make them actually accept that I'm a real guy who has voted with them for a decade, every election since I became an adult. I basically bled blue and the one time I speak up about something that I think is wrong, every one of them immediately thinks "that's not a real person, that's a Russian bot". What the hell happened to this party? 
And you know what I think? I think they don't care. They don't give a crap that I'm fed up with it, and one of them jokingly linked this sub as a response. I hadn't heard of walkaway before, but I'm really glad there are people out there with some of the same perspectives I've had. After how I was treated over something so petty, I just have no faith in the party anymore. We should be trying to get as many people to vote blue as possible, not dismiss everyone with, "bye Felicia" if they aren't going to be as extreme. 

Republicans and conservatives just have a different energy in their posts. It isn't as vitriolic, it isn't as perverted in content, it honestly seems like they're having a good time with each other for the betterment of the nation and that just really resonates with me. I decided to walkaway and vote red this coming election because I want to be around people that make me feel good. I want to read content that makes me laugh, not stuff that makes me upset. I want to be part of something that includes as many people as possible, that tries to make this world better. That something just isn't the democratic party anymore. 

I'm just so fucking offended that after years of service and working with these guys, my friends!, they're just like, "see ya fake Democrat. Leave". I shouldn't be so upset but I can't help it. Spent my life with the party and they don't give a damn. I said one thing and all that work, all those votes and donations, nothing matters because only a bot or a Russian or a troll would say something.

I'm gonna get off the internet for a bit and go for a run. 
What was the last straw for you guys? How did you find this sub?  Someone Linked Me This Sub As A Joke...
Humidor_Abedin I've argued with a ton of them, and they just insult &amp; degrade. They aren't changing my mind and I'm not changing theirs but they still come here to argue daily. Are the argumentative NPC's here solidifying your decision?

Who's with me? My #WalkAway story
JoeyRamos1 FELLOW PATRIOTS HELP ME GET TO D.C 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been encouraged to see so many brave people taking a stand for conservative values. I have officially decided to go to the #WALKAWAY march on Oct 27 to stand amongst others and show the media that we are not Russian bots. Many are walking away from the leftist manipulation and political deceit. I've seen the left flirting with Socialism. They really want to go down this road. Many people have died fighting against socialism. Hispanics have a history of socialism and communist rule and for us not to care about the importance of conservative values. This is a march towards freedom. There are moments in time where you have to take a bold stand for what's right. It's time to draw the line. I just can't stay home and let this pass me by. I may not have the initial funds nor have George Soros funding my trip but I know I can count on you to help get me to Washington D.C I gotta give it all I got. I will be staying the weekend hopefully at the Trump Hotel to attend all of the WALKAWAY events. From the Gala Dinner to Cocktail Vip Party. I want to meet and hear peoples stories and connect with this new group of people that are really making a difference. Along with this I will document and write about this historic event on my blog Varietyvoice. Cause we all know we can't count on the mainstream media to cover this. Hey like my president says, "As long as you're going to be thinking anyway, think big" Go Big or Go home. Fellow patriots, I need your help to get to Washington DC. Let's show the left that this is a reall grassroots movement one that's not funded by billionaires but by the people for the people. Thank You :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B; GEORGE SOROS WONT FUND THIS. BUT I'M STILL GOIN' TO THE WALKAWAY MARCH
bluejedi24 As a young adult who has always been heavily interested in politics and government since a very early age, I'm facing a challenging dilemma right now in American politics. Most of my family has always voted Democratic, and I leaned liberal all through my teens as well. Supported Obama, and still think he was a pretty good president. 

I have never liked Trump as a person. But at the same time, and I'm sure you'll hear this from many people, I am disgusted with the direction and strategy of the Democratic Party and the Left, basically ever since Obama left office. It's shifting farther left. The progressive wing is becoming really extreme, both in policy positions and political behavior. As I've gotten older, gone to college, and learned more about the world, I have to admit I've become less liberal. I still might lean slightly left-of-center, but I am really not a fan of the Democratic Party right now. I could go on for hours about that, but I won't, because I think people can at least understand the basics of the current political dynamics in America.

So looking ahead to the midterms, I'm really stuck on what to do. I wouldn't call myself a conservative at all (although I do have a mix of both conservative and liberal views), and I'm not a fan of most conservative candidates either. However, some of the things that Democrats are pushing for are going in a very socialist direction that I am quite worried about. There are so many large-scale implications to this, too...things that connect concepts of individuality to broader society and philosophy...just so much stuff that could be discussed.

As a very moderate liberal, I feel like I don't have a home. I'm disappointed in the moderate liberal wing's inability to reject and denounce far-left positions and behavior. I was wrong about Trump. I though he would crash the GOP and I thought the Democratic Party would unify. It ended up being the exact opposite, basically. 

So...just wondering if there is anyone else out there like this in a similar situation. For my midterm election ballot, I may simply evaluate each and every race individually and vote for the candidate who I like the most or agree with the most. Technically I guess that is what we should always do anyway, in every election. I can't say whether they will be Dems, Republicans, or a mix of both. There are Green Party and Libertarian Party candidates too, but I've always felt weird about voting for 3rd party when they basically have no chance to win in our current culture. Feel free to share your thoughts and advice you may have for determining who to vote for when I'm really disgusted with almost everyone and everything that is going on. Dilemma: What types of candidates to vote for in midterms?
Csauter36   For many of us, we were exposed to some kind of "awakening" or even "red-pilling". It most likely took 1 thing to stumble on another, or series of things and realizing we were being lied to.
   In my story specifically, I slowly began listening to people, videos/podcasts/articles of people I probably would have never given a chance because of being taboo or only hearing terrible labels on them. 
  For me, I have 4 people that influenced me. 
 It eased in with Joe Rogan. Just the fact he would listen to anything, ask questions about anything; something that almost isn't allowed anymore. 
  About that time I had discovered Jordan Peterson, and he opened my eyes to the seriousness of some things I never would have thought about.
  And the last two, that really pulled me out of the lefts grasps were Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro. Sure, I might not agree with all of what they say, but they sure as hell weren't anything close to what the left had been labeling them as. 
  I did a test. YouTube "conservative owns" and see that stacks of videos, backed by facts and stats backing a viewpoint.
  Now do "liberal owns.." and see what you get. A couple videos of mostly just a crowd jeering and no real substance. 
  I've recently gotten into Steven Crowder, and he amazes me with his willingness to step into any situation for a debate.
  Do you have people, not just times, that have influenced you? Why hear stories of why, but can we get a thread of "who"s?

MedwedianPresident_1 Few people know that the “Democrats” were actually SUPPORTING slavery and segregation until at least the civil war. They have always been the party which supported “intolerance” and racism. 

The Republicans - conservatives - were those who abolished the great injustice of slavery in the United States. Lincoln was a Republican. Lincoln was a conservative. Calling Republicans “nazis” is dire defacement of Lincoln.

The wolf may have put on a sheep’s coat - but behind the coat of leftist and feminist fascism hides a primal fascism and hate that trumps even Hitler and Mussolini. The “Democratic” Party has nothing to do with democracy.

Kennedy was murdered by his own people. They conspired against him because he fought against their fascist goals. He was a “real” democrat. He wanted freedom for the American people; he wanted to release top-secret documents pertaining to extraterrestrial civilizations and free energy (watch Cosmic Disclosure).

Republicans and conseratives are the true democrats.

If you are a member of the fascist, leftist brood that dares to call itself “the Democrats”, please follow this line of advice:

Leave. The. “Democratic”. Party. NOW.

You are being fooled. You are being turned into a pawn in the chess game the Antichrist and the New World Order are playing against God. History of the “Democratic” Party
I_AM_DONE_HERE I'm still not sure if this sub is actually filled with Walkaway Dems with posts like "MAGA hat challenge", but it's at least one of the few places where criticism of the Left won't get downvoted to hell. 

But are there any other people here who still agree with most (but not all) liberal *policies*, but find the general *behavior* of liberals to be off-putting, bordering on scary?

I feel like my views haven't changed at all, but the political party that holds them has gone insane.

For instance, I will likely not agree with most of the decisions Kavanaugh makes on the Supreme Court. But with the absolute shit show the left put him through, I almost felt like rooting for him by the end of it. And beyond that, Trump has the right to nominate who he wants, that's how the rules work. If Dems don't like it, they need to start winning elections.


How do you conflate those two realities?

I am also very interested to see how this part is received here. Agree with most left policies, but disgusted with the way leftists act, anyone else?

cvanfossen368 Okay, last night I had the strangest dream that I think kind of confirms my walk away from the democratic party. Be prepared because this dream is kinda weird and graphic. 

I was left with babysitting two little boys that looked fully developed, but they were the sizeof what a baby at the the point of about one to two months of development in the womb would be. One was wearing a blue piece of clothing and the other was wearing red. For whatever reason, I lost track of the baby in the blue piece of clothing. And he had an unfortunate demise after getting his head stuck in between the bars of an empty dog crate. Either this represents my walkaway from the democratic party, or it was just a weird/crazy dream that I woke up from at 3am. I had the strangest dream...

dd525 I am black but i tihnk affirmative action should be used only for class and not race. I have been following the Harvard asian american trial where some asian students feel they are being discrimanated against because they are have to score higher on test then whites,blacks,and latinos.https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/harvard-really-about-affirmative-action/573064/ I believe affirmative action if used should just be used for class. I feel that if one just uses race it becomes divisive,and confusing like the Harvard trial where it seems that there is no win/win situation. What are your thoughts? Is the Harvard case an example of why affirmative action is bad?
Burning_Lovers I turned 18 in 2008 and saw Obama as pure hype and didn't see much of a difference between him and McCain 

in 2012, the election looked like a joke 

in 2016, I vaguely supported Hillary but refused to vote knowing that Trump would win anyway, unlike my liberal friends who were overconfident in her victory 

finally, in 2018, after seeing all the political violence, the mob actions, the sheer hatred, I've decided that it's beyond time to vote 

my state, California, is hopelessly liberal, but I decided that despite their adamant liberalism, I still have a voice

I can still make a stand, make my voice heard, and do my part to end the violence, the mobs, the hatred

it's time 

I'm voting straight ticket Democratic next month 

thank you all and your stories for showing me that even during the darkest of times there's hope if we believe in ourselves and our convictions time to #walkaway from being a nonvoter!
Clatsop Over the last seven months, thousands of former progressives have joined the #WalkAway campaign, sharing their own stories on social media.

 Over the last seven months, thousands of former progressives have joined the #WalkAway campaign, sharing their own stories on social media. Here are a couple of Compilation videos highlighting some of those.
throwalkaway I'm posting this on a throwaway because I mostly only participate in gaming subs, including being a mod of a moderately sized one on my main account, and have some information on there that could potentially be used to dox me. That's been happening to people too much lately and since I really don't feel like taking the chance of getting doxxed by political crazies for a simple opinion, I figured making a new account to post this would be best. I'm sure I'll probably get called out by people on the left for it, but whatever, I felt like I really needed to share this and lately they usually believe whatever they want to believe anyway lol.

For most of my life I probably would have considered myself center-left on the political spectrum and have voted mostly for Democrats, with a couple of Republican governors and state reps sprinkled in. I was always raised to believe in things like equal rights for all, helping one another whenever possible, commitment to the truth, and compromise. I guess I've always thought, for the most part, that Democrats best represented those qualities. But over the past year or so I've come to see that just isn't the case anymore.

Since Trump was elected, Democrat politicians have shown to be increasingly combative on almost every single issue, and usually just for the sake of being combative! So many things in this country still need to get done and Democrats continuously refuse to compromise. It's honestly a miracle that Trump has gotten as much done as he has with the stonewalling from Democrats. I just can't bring myself to side with a party that puts itself before their country any longer.

Another thing that has increasingly concerned me about the left is how radical their voting base has become. Antifa is violent and out of control. Other liberals hold marches and protests that shut down public streets every weekend just for the sake of attention and not any real issues. You just don't see that level of unhinged from the right. I worry that if it grows large enough and more of these people gain power that it could lead us down the path to socialism. While I still believe in having some form of basic social safety net, what these people want is pure and total socialism. We need to keep our sanity and not let this country end up like Venezuela.

I think the straw that finally broke the camel's back though was the Kavenaugh hearings. The politicians and people on the left jumped on completely uncorroborated allegations as if they were cold hard truth. Republicans gave them every opportunity to come up with real proof, including an FBI investigation and they could not do it. I think this event more than any other perfectly showed to me who the real party of truth and objectivity was.

Those being the major reasons, I will not be voting for Democrat candidates anymore and this is my #walkaway from that party. Maybe somewhere down the road, when some semblance of sanity and civility returns to that party I can reconsider my stance, but I won't be holding my breath. I voted Democrat most of my life. Not anymore. This is my #walkaway.
ChakanGenesis If you've paid attention to r/politics (and you really shouldn't be, if you value your sanity), you might notice a common theme.

Some rabid looney with a van full of Trump stickers is so unhinged from reality that he actually thinks that he's making a mailbomb by tying a wire into a digital clock? Trump's fault. Vote for Democrats to #Resist! Some full-on Nazi who hates Trump shoots up a synagogue? Trump's fault. Vote for Democrats to #Resist!

You'll see a lot of convoluted not-really-arguments about how Trump (and not any other actor in the political space, particularly not the ones outright calling for targeted harassment) has been fanning the flames of [insert ideology here] because of [insert quote here]. It's formulaic, and you can make literally anything fit the formula. Try it yourself: play National Tragedy Mad Libs. You can even roll dice if you like. for ethnicity of assailant, target, stated reason, and method of attack. Then find out a way to blame Trump. It's easy if you know how: say that [word] really means [completely different word] when Trump says it. Say a bunch of mumbo-jumbo about "the national conversation" and "stochastic terrorism" if you don't have any other ideas. You have a huge pool to draw from; you can make pretty much anything fit the narrative if you're creative enough.

To put this differently - do you think that any national tragedy could happen while Trump is president and that he **won't** be blamed for it?

The United States is a big country. There were lunatics in it when Obama was president. When Bush was president. When Clinton was president (Anyone else remember Jack Thompson and David Grossman blaming video games for Columbine? I'm getting the same whiff here. So glad that's mostly over with). When the other Bush was president, when Reagan was president... when Washington was president, certainly. There's 300 million people, and far too many of them are crazy. Statistically, one of them is eventually going to do something that's both noteworthy and batshit insane, and I don't want to make any claims of who's putting on dancing shoes when they do so close to election time.

[Meanwhile, universities are saddling lots and lots of students with lots and lots of debt for degrees in political indoctrination while we have a serious homelessness problem, gang violence is killing thousands, opiates (some of which are fentanyl-laced) are killing tens of thousands, obesity is killing hundreds of thousands if not millions, and old age (a treatable condition if we move medicine forward enough) is killing us all.]

Don't walk away from liberalism if you don't want to, but for the love of fucking God, walk away from responding to lunacy with more lunacy. Walk away from using tragedies to make political hay.
mrssilverfox I remember when Trump won and I posted a #democracyisdead hashtag. How wrong I was.... About everything. 

Now I see everyone as if they have a curtain pulled down over their eyes. I constantly want to say "Wait! You are on the wrong side. You don't even realize what is going on here!" But I have a hard time believing I could change anyone's mind. 

I'm a Canadian waiting for a visa to get into the states. And while I wait I stay with my parents. My mom went door to door for Hillary. They have told me that they are scared for me. They can see I'm changing, that my morals are changing. When my mom said that Donald Trump is like Hitler I'm the crazy one for disagreeing with her. I accidently left Fox news on the TV the other day and it ended in an epic blow out. 

I am marrying a republican. I can see that people think I am being brainwashed. But I am smarter now than I have ever been before. I can clearly see both sides. I believe that Democrats really do want to be good people underneath it all. But sometimes I think maybe it was easier when I had the veil on my eyes. It was easier belonging to a group and not thinking for myself. I lived the first 30 years of my life thinking feelings were more important than facts. That not offending someone was more important than truth. 

Knowing now that I disagree with almost everyone I know, and not because they are bad people but they are ignorant, is stressful. It scares me that I was so wrong about so many things going on in the world. I had everything so twisted. It scares me that so many good people can have it so backwards. 

Thank God for the intellectual dark web. For the Rubin Report, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson etc. For conversation, level headed debate, open minded people. Whether I agree with everything these people say or not is not the point. I am learning... For the first time. 

I watched the Rubin Report last night with Glenn Beck. I had never even heard of him before. A quick Google search tells me I may not agree with alot of what he has to say. But when he spoke about the Holocaust and the people who stood by and did nothing while it happened it really affected me. People who had a curtain pulled down over their eyes. That we are entering an evolution where people have to know who they really are, what their morals are and the difference between right and wrong. I hope that people on both the left and the right can do that. I hope we can find common ground.

blueconsuegra I am planning on voting republican on November 6th, but reading up about Steve West has me a bit concerned. His views seem very extreme regarding the Jewish community and gay community. He has even tried to link pedophilia with homosexuality which is absolutely insane to me, and his views on vaccines don't make any sense; but I also don't want Claire McCaskill for obvious reasons. Anyone have any insight about this?  Should we be worried about Steve West in Missouri?
PitoStinko I am wondering if any News outlets anywhere have actually announced a call to action against whites like CNN's Don Lemon did recently.  His remarks put CNN to the fringe left of media outlets and I do not know of any other far left media outlets that have taken such a hard stance against Whites.  Combine this with virtually the entire network's mouthpieces calling for open borders in relation to this caravan, and I think that makes CNN our most extreme left wing network, great or small.  Thoughts? Is CNN the most radical left wing news outlet in the world?

-Red_Beard- This subreddit is full of some of the most backward, creepy, and fucking horrendous shit I’ve seen in a while. 

This place is literally fascism in its most pure, raw form, literally almost exactly as it was originally a hundred years ago. 

Just an honestly disgusted and revolted human being hoping for full trans, gay, black, and female liberation, and an abolition of the ruling class. Hoping for a total abolition of capitalism and hierarchy, social, economic, or political. 

I literally bought a new with the money George Soros gave me to write this post. 



 This subreddit is kinda insane actually

r3df0x_556 I've rejected socialism because it doesn't work and it's supporters are all tyrannical and arrogant.  The trouble with free market capitalism is it's just as much of an idealistic system that will never happen and only result in tyranny.  I think it's unlikely, but I'm actually concerned about living in a privatized version of the USSR.  In a way the mainstream left is actually pushing for this with extensive deplatforming under "muh private company" while conservatives are pushing for compelled speech on social media sites.

For all the flaws of free market capitalism, I'd rather live in a privatized USSR then the tyrannical and wimpy disaster that crypto marxist places like Sweden and California are turning into.  

The mainstream left's hatred of manly men is the reason why I will never vote for them again.  They flat out perform conversion therapy on cis children.  Unfortunately conservatives perform conversion therapy on trans children.  If it were up to me conversion therapy on any child, cis or trans, would be child abuse.  We need more leftists like Teddy Roosevelt.

I had a dream recently that was a lot like Call of Duty in Seelow Heights in terms of the appearance and feel.  I was fighting along side Republicans near Los Angeles which was the left wing capital.  I'd do it if ever happened because I'd rather abandon all of my progressive goals then live in a tyrannical nanny state filled with racial identitarians that tax everyone to death and perform conversion therapy on cis people.  We fought along side political idealists in World War II against a greater evil and I'll do it again. I'm voting Republican even though I disagree with them
dennismiller2024 I started wearing my maga hat in public to show support for my president, Donald J Trump. He is bringing jobs back, the economy is great, and overall he’s making America great again. I started wearing the hat in public as a protest against speech silencing that is so frequent on college campuses. My college is pretty apolitical though, so there wasn't the same threat of violence from wearing the hat on campus as there would be if I wore the hat on the liberal campuses I read about all too often.

I have never seen a maga hat in the wild, but if I did I would give the guy a high five for braving the social stigma that comes with the hat. No one gave me a high five when I wore the hat the first day, no one yelled at me either though. It was a bit disappointing that everybody had an apathetic reaction to the hat. I think that some people restrained their true feelings because I constantly got dirty looks with no further action to back them up. So wearing the hat was not the event that I expected it to be. That was until I went home to my apartment.

I live in a studio apartment alone. The rent is cheap and it’s got a bed and a kitchen which is all I really need. I’ve got my laptop for entertainment and I don’t really have friends so the crummy apartment fills its role. The first night that I wore the hat, I went home and took off my hat to go to bed. But as soon as I took off the hat I heard a muffled noise. It was faint but I had never heard anything like that before, especially in this apartment, and it also didn't come from a specific direction. It sounded like someone was speaking with heavy distortion out of a surround sound system in my room. I tried to make out what the words were saying or if they even were words, but it was unintelligible. I thought that it was likely just a weird song one of my neighbors was playing.

I started to drift off in my bed alone. The noise got louder suddenly and woke me up. This time it was less distorted and I could make out what it was saying. “Naziiiiiii Naziiiiii Naziiiii," it said, “We don’t want you naziiiiiiiii. We want you far away naziiii.”

“First of all I don’t know who you are. Second of all, do you know what nazi stands for? National socialism. So tell me this, how am I a capitalist Nazi? How do you reconcile that asshole. Do you know what else the nazi’s did besides killing jews? They silenced political dissidents. Sound familiar? It’s what you’re trying to do right now!”

I didn’t hear anymore noises that whole night. Whatever had been talking to me, left, presumably because it couldn’t answer my questions. I was finally able to sleep in peace.

I went to class the next day thinking that maybe the voice would try to confront me. I wore my maga hat proudly both because I was proud to have shut down someone’s argument, and also to help the voice confront me in person. Nobody talked me the whole day. I still got the dirty looks, nobody said anything. I went back to my apartment thinking that the voice had given up, but when I took off my hat to go to bed it came back, louder and clearer than before.

“Raciiiiiiiist. Raciiiiiiist. Raciiiiiiist,” it said.

“Show your face! Or are you too scared?” I yelled, “If you don’t want to show me who you are then leave me the FUCK alone.”

The voice continued, “Raciiiiist. Hate speeeeech. We don’t want you here, spew your hate speech somewhere else.” The voice got clearer as it spoke, and the sound became more centralized in the corner of my room where I could see a small dot of light. I couldn’t speak as I watched the light slowly get bigger until it was the size of a baseball. I screamed.

Someone knocked on the door and asked why they heard screaming coming from my room. I told them that I saw a spider and I apologized for the disturbance. When they left, the light and the voice were gone. I stayed up all night in fear.

The next day I went to class like normal wearing my maga hat. I wasn’t expecting anyone to confront me because I had two possible theories about what was going on. Either there was a liberal ghost in my apartment, or the more likely option was that Hillary Clinton’s team had found me and were taunting me until I switched to their side. When I went back to my apartment that evening, I started talking to that corner of the room where the light was last night. “Hillary Rodham Clinton, you will not silence me. You will not change my mind. I am a Donald J Trump supporter through and through and if you and your communist buddies don’t stop harassing me I will call the cops.” The voice started with a sharp piercing sound that alarmed me. It was so obvious to me at that moment that the police wouldn’t help me, they were getting demands from Clinton. The voice started speaking.

“Misogynist. Racist. Sexist. Islamophobe. Bigot. Rapist.”

I put on the hat. “Is this what you want!? Is this what you want?! You know what? I am a racist. I am a sexist. I am a misogynist. I am a bigot. I am a rapist. Call me whatever the FUCK you want Hillary, because it won’t change who I really am inside. I am a patriot, something that you will NEVER be!”

The light appeared again in the same corner of the room growing before my eyes. “Misogynist. Racist. Sexist. Islamophobe. Bigot. Rapist.” As it grew, it started morphing into a human-like figure. The light started expanding off the wall until there was a faint human figure made out of light. “Misogynist. Racist. Sexist. Islamophobe. Bigot. Rapist.” It continued, “My name is Diana.” Diana, why did that name sound so familiar? And then it hit me.

Diana Adelman was a antifa activist who used to lead protests whenever prominent right wing figures were speaking. When Ben Shapiro spoke at our school last year, she organized her biggest protest ever. It started with dozens of students holding signs outside of the auditorium, but that didn’t do anything. So Diana started antagonizing people that went to see Ben Shapiro speak. One guy was walking into the auditorium, and Diana deciding to attack him. In self defense, the guy pulled out his gun and shot her, killing her. The guy was sent to jail for life, and the political life on campus died with Diana.

“Diana Adelman, what do you want?”

“I want your hate speech off of this campus.”

Diana emerged from the corner for the first time and charged at me. I screamed. But I didn’t feel anything, just a light breeze. “Too much soy in your diet to hurt me,” I taunted her.

“I don’t want to hurt you. I want to silence you.”

“Diana, look. I’m sorry that you died, but... You know what? I’m not apologizing. You attacked that man for his political opinions, and suffered the consequences, and you still haven’t learned your lesson? We can’t be silenced. We will take back this country and people like you cannot stop us.” Diana slowly moved back to the corner. “I’ve been called a racist, I’ve been called a sexist, I’ve been called a rapist, I’ve been called a pedophile. I’ve been called every single bad thing you can call someone, and just because you’re a ghost doesn’t mean you’re any different from the rest of them. You’re just an NPC.” Diana shuddered at my logic, or so I thought.

“That was a good speech. We’ll see if you have that same energy tomorrow.”

Everyday Diana sits in the corner of my room trying to silence me. She was right. I don’t have the energy to fight back anymore. So that’s where I’m at right now. Every night I have sleep through those six words on repeat: “Misogynist. Racist. Sexist. Islamophobe. Bigot. Rapist.” I was haunted for wearing a maga hat. This discrimination needs to end.
psychosocialpursuit So I've entered a sort of renaissance in my life as I'm rediscovering myself, who I am, and the type of man I want to be. 

At 18 I registered Republican. 

At around 20 I registered Democrat and increasingly became more and more liberal. 

At around age 23 I registered libertarian. But still very liberal in many ways. I was a democratic sympathizer and liberal sympathizer.

At 25, almost 26, I've gotten in touch with the truth and ultimately gotten in touch with my true conservative values. But I was ashamed. Afraid. Not sure if I would be hated because of my re-ignited cored values and understanding.

But I don't care anymore. I'm a moderate conservative and I'm tired of the radical left pidgeon holing me and judging me because of my race, creed, and sex but then claiming I'm the intolerant one. 

So happy I found this subreddit. Is there seriously 8,000 people just like me?

askredditgarbageacct I was a Dumbocrat for over 28 years because my family was full of dumbocrats and I didn't know any better. That changed when I saw the documentary 'Loose Change 9/11'. Obviously the twin towers were exploded in a planned explosion, but all the liberals said no it was a terrorist attack. Huh? That had me concerned that I was supporting the bad guys.

Then, Trump rolls around. He says all the things that I've been wanting forever. A wall! A better economy! A strong leader who will stand up to the Democrats! Why wasn't 'my side' doing something like this? It was too late. I voted Hillary in 2016, but I've decided that I will for sure support Trump in 2020, especially with all the clowns running on the left now. Why I decided to walk away #WalkAway

PitoStinko Just thought I’d throw that out there.  Any leftists feel like disagreeing? America will never be a socialist nation!
PitoStinko Do they not realize that just because the tyrant says they are on your side, does not mean it’s actually true.    Most authoritarians didn’t rise to power by saying they wanted to rule over everything.  They appealed to emotion, showed empathy, then destroyed many of the very people who put them in power.  I’m very curious why liberals are so willing to give up others freedoms so they can get their way now, without any foresight to what that would mean for their rights when it gets in the tyrants way. 

So I ask any liberals here why they want government to have so much power?  What do they think they will gain?   Liberals do you have any concerns with government having absolute power?  Why not? Why is it that liberals are so willing to let the government use tyranny to take down those they don’t agree with, without actually considering any consequences?

My flair should be "never been on this sub before, and hop'n I don't get a back lash of negativity". I just watched a video in which Lynne Patton talks about being called many horrible names. Wouldn't it be great if she received an outpouring of appreciation at this point? I'm not American, but she strikes me as rather dedicated to helping the less advantaged in her country.
isaiditnowireddit hey, im a new yorker.  im interracial, im a dude, im 10-15 years out of university.  Im liberal arts educated on the northeast.  i thought taking radical philosophy was cool.  i never wore a che guevara hat but i thought it was cool - and his image spoke of enlightment and dignity.  I was the type to scream at the TV when a conservative black man was on fox.....and granted id do the same to the rest of them.  Things began to change around 2013-2015 for me.  I began seeing the effects of radicalization - and with a bit of life experience i saw the limitations of some of the theories and attitudes taught to me in university and my circles.  I began to imagine that people that didnt "believe" what I did were very like good people, and that I may actually be missing POVs that I could incorporate or were better and more DESCRIPTIVE of life than "mine".  2016 I hadnt connected the cultural with the political, per se.  But quickly after 2016 things began to snowball and i found myself still a liberal, but without party - and now without any compatriots in this cold ass city lol.  

Its hard to be in "society" or even "hang out"  when everyone has drunk from this kool aid - even when they are the elite.  And if they havent drunk from it they are disinterested or afraid to offer DISCUSSION to those with differing opinions.  People aren't allowed to dissent.  This city is stifling.  the left is dying - or changing into a new grotesque creature.

What happened to discussion?  When did the EDUCATED decide that only certain views or questions where allowed?  Am i only discovering, now, a timeless truth?  It feels as if its worse.....or maybe I've just become more PRAGMATICALLY CRITICAL of my own ideas....maybe ive really understood what inquiry is.  And, maybe im alone in that journey.  

It affects everything.  THere is less room to live and express yourself.  My relationships are fraying because i feel the inability to have simple discussion, because everything is verboten - or impolite.  One can't look at the world and describe it.....everything is prescriptive and UNANSWERABLE.  

And, im alone in this.  Those close to me are too scared or always disinclined to be a person that speaks from their heart as truly as possible.  The last bit of the child in me has died.  Im a full adult now; hope is only where one can control their own expectations of others and life..........

the dems are the living breathing embodiement (maybe not uniquely so) of our societies loss of any sort of self respect and obligation to reality.......after all - im screaming out into the world on a fucking internet message board.  dystopia. Im a bit hopeless...
PitoStinko Let's say the right fails, which honestly is a strong possibility at this point given how powerful the brainwashing in the media is and we get reparations for Blacks in the form of cash stipends, because let's be honest, that is what \[6 out of 10\]([https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/247178/reparations-black-americans-attitudes-race.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/247178/reparations-black-americans-attitudes-race.aspx)) Black Americans want, its what the \\#cutthecheck and the \\#ADoS community wants, it is what CNN wants, and quite frankly it is what Democrat politicians want since it will keep lowlifes voting D.  On a side note, it really says a lot about Blacks who want reparations that most of them want cash handouts over money towards their community.  Really makes you think.  Anyways if democrats do win in 2020, and I am afraid they will, reparations will be hastily brought through the House by mobsters like the squad.  Weak republicans and hungry democrats will pass it, and it will sail its way through the senate which is full of some of the most timid politicians who seem to only care about getting re-elected, and we know how it will go from there if a D controls the WH.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course cash handout reparations will be popular within the Black community.  Why the hell wouldn't it be?  You have to be a fool not to accept no questions asked money.  And the democrats know this.  They will sell out their own country and its future just to get another term.  So where does that leave their vote come 2024?  You would have almost 100% of Black vote for Democrats, and manipulation is a balancing act for them.  As their Black vote increases, other minority voting blocks will decrease.  So the master manipulators will push for their next big push to the left, and what brings me back to the question in the post title.

&amp;#x200B;

Reparations for undocumented Americans and their descendants...

&amp;#x200B;

You think this sounds crazy?  Well remember, the left was calling the right crazy when they suggested back in 2012 and 2013 that the left would push for reparations for slavery.  If you don't believe the left will go here, then you have not been paying attention to how far the left has pushed this country in the last decade.  And I can already see how they will sell it too, being sure to give a wink to Latinos that as long as you come from Central America, you get a check.  They will say that employers benefited from hiring and underpaying illegals, that all of America, particularly the privileged Whites, benefited from illegal labor.  You will be called a racist if you disagree.  Idiots like Don Lemon, who in my opinion is one of the most radical left media figures in history, will get on air and cry about undocumented immigrants and how it isn't fair we have not payed them back.  You know the spiel.

Just be warned, liberals.  Reparations doesn't end at reparations for Blacks, that is where it starts. What the reparations argument will look like in 2024
geezerblab I feel some what cheated! I was using the tag #walkaway before you guys were! But for me it meant just walking away from the machine.

I've almost always been liberal. (As in liberty liberal.) There was that time Ross Perot ran, but other than that, I've voted democrat..  until 2016. After that year, I now consider them decept-o-crats because everything they do is deceptive. 

So I recently found the walk away movement and was intrigued. It said on the YouTube interviews that it wasn't conservative, that #walkaway was for people who were fed up with identity politics and the intolerant left. (If I'm a "bleeding heart liberal" it's because compassion, not because I'm "better than" anyone else.) 

But then I see more walk away videos and pretty much every single one of them has been a commercial for the conservative party, or so it seemed.

I think Trump is better than HRC, or any of the current offering and frankly, the media with their lies is really turning me toward being a Trump supporter... But there are a lot of values conservatives have that I don't agree with and I feel that Trumps wall would likely become a prison wall. (Even if you like Trump, remember the wall will be there after he leaves office, the next administration may have "other" uses for it)

The media has shown Trump to be a man without compassion. This has always been my biggest complaint with him. Trump is a scrooge who doesn't care about anyone... then I hear about the way he didn't actually mock anyone with a disability and the "concentration camps" are bogus. I have a better understanding of what he's trying to do with immigration now, and I might disagree but he's not a monster! 

I'm forced to realize I have no idea if Trump is a compassionate person. 

But I'm pro choice, (pro 4th amendment) think the military is way overblown and I do think we have a serious issue with rampant police and a judicial system that enables them to murder citizens without consequence. Basically, non conservative positions. 

Is #walkaway just a conservative thing? Is #walkaway conservative only?

LookAdam If a sub could be a clown, this would be it. No one is buying this “left turned right” bish. Alt-right trolls are gonna troll, and there’s nothing we can do about that I guess. Continue spreading your hate, as you wish. I love how one of the “rules” is no racism. Do you apply your own rules to your brain dead supporters? Nah.

Ban me really quickly, please. Just help prove who the real “snowflakes” are in this day and age. Can’t take my criticism...bitches. Idiotic Right
Peach_Pirate I saw the table at my college today and although i didn't stop because everyone was in the middle of talking, I want to say good job and i am so happy that this is present on my campus to encourage other college students to WalkAway. I saw a walk away table at my campus!
FreeBee13 I just had a conversation with a friend recently about their dislike of trump, where she admits ro holding the view of thinking fox news is unreliable and that networks like NBC or ABC news are.

This makes me realize how many people still believe the lies, when they still turn on these channels. I stopped watching tv for this reason, and have felt my views on politics have changed for the better.

I want to try convincing people, friends, acquaintances and even strangers alike to give up watching the news, I can see once people give that up they could be easier to convince to walk away. 
Would anyone have advice in how to convince someone to stop watching tv all together or at least cut down? How do I convince people to stop watching the mainstream news and tv in general?

BLEXIT_VOTE_TRUMP 
I think whitе gеnocide is wiggty wack. If you know what in sayin. Y'all migrаtion are replacing. Whitеs should be allowed to exist just like any other rаce. When blаcks (me) advocate for blаck rights people praise us. It should be the same for whitеs. Yo need a white civil rights movement. As a blаck man y'all are shaming and hating people for being whitе.

You should be able to be proud of your heritiage just like blаcks (me) are proud of our blаck history.

No  one should  be ashamed of being whitе, just like blаcks (me) should not bе ashamed of being blаck. 

So white people should exist. The media should stop pushing race mixing propaganda. This hurts both white people and blacks like me. 

Yes the far right is pretty bad but the left is terrible too. Pushing racism against whites is not ok. 

I personally watch both left wing media and right wing media which results in a SOLID center unbiased view. If we all do this and take the good parts of BOTH sides than we will have the perfect system. Climate change is real, and so is the fact that blacks (me) how a lower IQ and their is an agenda to replace white peoplw.


Im afraid to bring this up to my homies cause im afraid all the backlash. What should it do?

The media news keeps promoting rave mixing agenda. 

Im agianst BOTH alt-left and alt-right!

Liberals have always treated us black conservatives as trash, black conservatives can think for themselves, and this angers liberals. Liberals think they can control black people like me. They think black people are stupid and lesser. They are the racist ones.

It’s not racist to advocate for your own people, just like us blacks (myself) do it all the time. As a black fan, I think white genocide is wack.
cookingking Prior to the last election I had no problem knowing what I believed.  I was against military, war, guns, right to lifers, organized religion, country music, rednecks, God the list could go on and on.  

So I won't go into my "transition".  You who went thru it understand.  I describe it as having my belief system being turned inside-out.  

But what's bothering me is the guilt over how fucking WRONG I was for my whole life.  I'm old now, my parents have both died and I have grown children.  It kills me to remember the hurt look in my dad's eyes, and way Mom would sigh and shake her head at my attitudes.  Dad fought in WW2 for 4 stinking years, seeing his family one time during this period.  And yet I disrespected his service in my heart.  I disrespected my country, my family, many many friends and acquaintances.  Not verbally but in my heart and beliefs. I was a terrible person.  

I almost cried yesterday thinking about this.  I knew in my heart for years that my beliefs weren't holding up very well to my own scrutiny. I was too fucking stubborn to admit I was wrong to myself let alone those I love/loved.  I truly pray I will be much more careful with my beliefs in the future, but this guilt from past actions really brings me down. I Walked Away About 3 Years Ago and am still having trouble processing what's happened to me, as guilt over who I was before sometimes overwhelms me.

1001facts I fully believe that a big reason people don’t like Trump is that they’re ignorant of the facts. To combat this I’ve written a book and I’m giving it away for free. *1,001 Trump Facts: The Life, Accomplishments, and Legacy of Our 45% President* covers every aspect of Trump’s life and Presidency.  

If you like it please leave a review and help encourage others to read it.

bnewton18 I'm only about halfway through but this book is excellent.  Not only is he (Snowden) quite a good writer with a sense of humor he lays bare how what-has-come-to-be-known-as The Deep State actually works.  His story is frankly chilling.  I thought at the time he released the information ("blew the whistle") he was a patriot.  What he revealed should make us all concerned about our privacy and what freedom in America means anymore.    But the way he was and is treated, particularly vis-a-vis the current so-called "whistle-blower" is equally horrifying. It takes real bravery to act knowing what will likely happen to you.

I'd be quite interested in hearing other people's take on the book and/or Snowden. Checkout Edward Snowden's book: Permanent Record
