In 2016, we voted for the Republican ticket. It was harder to tell our friends that we were voting Republican than it was telling our family we were gay 20 years ago. We found ourselves stepping out of one closet and stepping into a darker one. Our ""friends"" knew how we were going to vote leading up to the election. They quickly deleted us from Facebook, sent us nasty and hateful messages, left voice mails on our phone calling us traitors, and immediately dropped us from social events. Like Thanos' snap, they disappeared within a matter of seconds. These actions just solidified and validated our choice even more. What did we do to respond? Took pictures of us eating Chik-fil-a fries and shopping at Hobby Lobby and shared it. We are voting Republican again in 2020.

With every riot, assault, doxxing and act of physical intimidation, portrayal of the assassination of the president, and threat towards Conservatives, we gain one step in advancing the Conservative cause to preserve our country against the Left's insanity and restore our Republic's constitutional greatness. So, do what you will. I've been doxxed, threatened, harassed, permanently shut down and lost 20,000 followers. We have been assaulted, attacked, stalked, targeted by the mainstream media and demonized.

Throughout most of my life I supported democrats and the left. I thought because I was gay I had to support them. I was told Republicans were out to take my rights away. I feared the Republicans from the day I found out I was gay. When I was about to graduate high school I watched Trump's speech for the first time. Remember at this point I was full support of Hillary. I felt something from what he said. I felt safe for the first time. I then started looking into the Republican party and found that they don’t hate me. I found great friends who still support me to this day. I voted for Trump. For the first time in my life I could see the lies that the democrats told me. I don’t have to vote democrat if I’m gay. I was attacked by people on the left because I left the Democratic Party.

Back when I was 18, I registered as a Democrat because at that age I really didn’t know much about what my political ideas were. Over the years I came to realize that I leaned much more conservative in my belief system. I remember back during the first Obama campaign watching him speak and understanding why people were mesmerized by him. I did not vote for him nor did I support him but once he became our president I prayed for him and never spoke out publicly with hatred and bashing. His presidency did so much to divide our great country and it’s sickening. Fast forward to today and the Trump campaign - Truthfully I was never really a Trump fan - I agreed with his ideas but wasn’t a fan...I voted for him because in my mind I was voting for the lesser of two evils. I was wrong about Trump. I truly believe he does want to make America great again and although he doesn’t always say things or do things that are politically correct his intentions are real and he’s following through with what he promised to do. The hate and bashing from the left sickens me. I actually had a family member publicly state that if any of his friends or relatives voted for Trump they were no longer allowed around his children. How is that OK? I just don’t understand any of it. This movement is refreshing and it is inspiring to read stories that align with the way I feel about our country and our President.

I voted for Obama in 2008 and again in 2012 because I felt he hadn't had enough time to implement the changes he wanted. I started to really question my choice shortly after the second election. I finally had to admit that the agenda was all talk and was supporting dishonest, dangerous policies. I was mortified when he turned his back on our law enforcement and Israel. I could finally see that politicians are bought and paid for and not in the least bit for the people of this country. I started to detest Hillary when she bashed the women abused by her husband and when the entire Democratic party rallied in support of him despite his perjury. Her corruption only became more apparent to me during Obama's administration. When she ran for President I felt myself cringe. I knew in my heart I could never support her, but I didn't really like Trump either. When her Email scandal was exposed, with all the evidence collected, I was appalled that there were no charges brought against her. She was never held to the same standards that we all are. The Clinton Machine is a dangerous, powerful, corrupt entity. I voted for Trump because he wasn't a politician. He was a businessman and was not in anyone's pocket. I became increasingly mortified at the amount of hate, fear, violence and intimidation promoted by the Democrats towards him and his family. The vicious attacks by the MSM. The vulgar, hateful, slanderous attacks by The Hollywood elite and this is all OK in their eyes. I realized then that I made the right choice in walking away. The Liberal Radical Left insanity going on has left me in their toxic dust. This is not the party I knew. I love to listen to Fox News and see civil discussions. I watch the investigations into DOJ and FBI and think to myself that none of this would have ever been exposed had Hillary won, the corruption runs deep. Trump loves America and is truly helping to expose and drain the swamp. I pray for his safety and continued success. The hypocrisy of the left is mind boggling and as long as they promote and defend illegal immigration, intimidation and suppression of free speech, public harassment, hate and violence, I know I can never support or be a part of them again.

When identity politics became more valid than having an argument. When you can publicly demonize white males to the point of celebrating them becoming “extinct” (literally something a friend told me).

I am Anti CORRUPT Union. I was raised in a a suburb of Detroit. Both my Mother and my father were hard working, blue collar Union workers. They were factory workers by trade, and our household was pure Democrat and members of the UAW. Politically, I was raised a Democrat but leaned Republican after watching Carter screw America so badly. I voted for Ronald Reagan for the presidency. Even though I wasn't impressed when he followed through with Jimmy Carter's previous agenda to bust the PATCO workers. I still liked Reagan's overall policies. After Clinton took office I was thoroughly convinced that BOTH parties had an equal hand in selling out the American workers by exporting jobs to slave trade countries. By 2008, I became convinced that the Republican Party had abandoned its conservative, constitutional principles and I started leaning Libertarian. Then comes Obama's tales of change and hope that had mislead the American people and he had carried the torch faithfully for Wall Street as much as any of his predecessors. He drove the knife in the backs of millions of union workers and is directly responsible for the attack on middle income workers with his attack on our wages while leaving the auto execs making billions!!!! His policies forced workers to 2 tier and even 3rd tier wages and forced us to give up our only effective bargaining tool by giving up our right to strike. He continued his attack on our jobs with BS agreements with Korea, NATO and WTO. I voted for Trump and now realize he is way better than Obama 2.0 (Hillary) ever could have been.

So I walked away from the Democratic Party when I was about 30 ( I am 37). I didn’t know any better and didn’t care to growing up. I grew up with Democrats and that is how I voted. I remember voting for Gore and hating Bush for whatever reason #brainwashed and my stepdad thought Clinton was awesome but until I got married and had my first kid it dawned on me that so should probably look the candidates up and see who actually seem fit to me (I also married a Republican ). I wasn’t crazy about McCain/ Paliin ticket but was a huge Palin fan so I voted for that one but honestly when Obama won I thought ok I will give him the benefit of the doubt and then I was almost 9 months pregnant and standing out on the side of the road with Mitt Romney signs with a hope and a bright future for my little one. Obama won and I was devastated and when we got hit with Obamacare and I actually felt the hurt of money out of our pockets because of the premiums I was furious. Trump may not have been my first pick but between him and Hillary there was no way I was #withher. This is a scary time. I worry about what kind of world will be left for our children and with the left loving socialism and getting out of control it’s only a matter of time.

Two days ago I was accepted and posted a short comment about how I felt about the direction this great nation was heading towards, and didn't want to join a group that was full of trash and hate. Today I have received over one thousand likes and love and I have lost track of all the welcome and positive comments posted on my simple post from fellow Americans! I think the saying of ""You had me at hello"" would be an understatement! I am now part of a group that is dedicated to America and even if we don't agree on the way we rebuild this great nation that in my opinion is even better! I have read many posts watched many videos and I have yet to see anything but respect from EVERYBODY! Why I was even interested in this group is three fold, 1st I want what I had growing up with for my grandchildren an America they can be proud of! 2nd, I am and foremost a God Fearing, flag waving, gun owning American and I stand and place my hand over my heart when the national anthem is played! I'm not a democrat nor a republican and last 3rd, Im looking and actually need to find other Americans to converse with and bounce ideas with! I am a swing vote voter and vote for who I think is going to be best for America! Now why I am I this way...childhood memories is the best I can come up with! My dad was a hardened veteran of WWII and a true blue southern baptist democrat from the south, my mom from the farmlands of our nation a true blue democratic Lutheran. My first memory on politics and religion was in 4 grade and Dwight Eisenhower was the setting President and who was running for president next but a young catholic man named John Kennedy, talk about a mixed heated debate coming from my parents and their friends would also be understated! JFK did win and I'm sure my parents reluctantly voted for him because they were democrats and so was he! What brought it together for them and me was the inaugural address he gave..."" My fellow Americans - Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country""! Zing, both my very hard working parents from the great depression were onboard with this new President and who I ask, who wouldn't be in 4th grade, haha! But that is the day I became an American! Over the years I tried my best to stand with candidates that spoke like they were Americans and over those years I saw a slide from one side to the other with the value I hold so dear and it was so slight I'm not sure to this day people realize that and hold fast to there side of the parties! What got me really off the band wagon was after 9-11 America came alive with patriotism beyond belief and who was running for president yeah a really good orator and yes I was strongly temped to vote for him but there was something about his way with words that triggered what a southern baptist smooth orator preacher said from high on the pulpit that scared the crap out of me at a young age, no I didn't vote for this smooth orator! Over the next 8 years I saw this smooth talker devastate and give away my America...to say I was upset would also be an understatement, no I never was going to shoot up the place or set fire to buildings or riot in the streets! Now then who next was running for president...yeah a person that killed Americans after she turned her back when they pleaded for help...yeah right, not going to vote for that sort of person and wondered why she was aloud to even run for office and this guy that pointed a finger and said ""Your Fired"" on TV, oh yeah and a communist plan and simple, ha, what a choice I was thinking we as Americans have! Okay I watched the debates and cringed when ""she"" had the floor, but found myself smiling when this your fired guy said he thinks she should in prison, (I wasn't alone in thinking she should not even been running for the highest office in the world), and he was blunt enough to say it on national TV. I then did my research on this business man and thought that is exactly the person to do what is needed for America, bring America back from where she was sent to be in the corner to collect dust and again light her torch and Be America Again! This man Our President the man that is an American, believes in God, stands with Americans both in and out of uniform, stands with farmers, auto workers, coal workers and stock brokers, rough around the edges, not a politician, does tweets that just tell it like it is and drives me up the wall at times, that tells leaders of counties and the UN the bank is closed, talks with our enemies, brings home our fallen heroes and does what he said he was going to do right there on the debating stage just over a year and a half ago, yeah I voted wisely and in my definition of voting I didn't vote democratic or republican I voted in a RAPTOR and I am ready to vote in more! I am seeing America sweep off the dust and starting to stand tall again, I now have hope for my grand babies future again! My friends, America is Americans not the dysfunctional politicians on both side of the aisle that we have at present! We are not democrats or republicans we are Americans! President Trump says drain the swamp and that is also way understated! Let's help this business man bring her back!

I just decided to post after that recent post of the man on here who had a neighbor leave a note to take his American flag down as it was a symbol of hate. Wow. Born and raised outside of Boston, we never talked politics in our family. My dad, a Marine, was a definite Republican and my mother said you never ask who someone votes for, when they are getting married or when they are having kids. {smart in the 70s, now we have to be vocal to keep our country together}. I never followed politics that much and when it came time to vote, I voted on issues I knew, but turns out, I had just sound bytes on. I voted Bush Sr., Bill Clinton., Bush Jr., Obama {twice} and now Trump {and will vote him again....if you see the pattern, everyone I vote for tends to win {smile}. My awakening came when I moved from a busy part of the country in New England to 45 minutes from any town in the southern rockies of Colorado. One fall afternoon, I was followed while out running by three men in a truck and it went on for an hour until I had to run through the woods and behind homes to my house as they frantically drove around looking for me. I was able to get home safe and did something I never thought I would have to do, and that was buy a gun, take a conceal carry class and practice it often. In a place with under 500 people in the fall and winter, no cell service at 8K feet in elevation and 45 minutes from police help, I was not having that happen twice. But when I told family and friends back east, they were shocked {as that isn't like me to own a gun} and I was told not to tell my nieces and nephews I owned a gun {because they are really not used to being around them and some of our family are not a fan of them}. That is when I saw the cultural difference between the northeast and southern Colorado. The difference between a liberal mentality towards our right to bear arms in the northeast {people not thinking guns should be in the hands of the average person} compared to the need and desire in the southwest and the conservatives views on it. It made me buy more, actually, and practice more and while I don't hunt, I enjoy it and add to my collection. A dear friend that I became close with would often ask me why I stood behind Obama. I honestly ""thought"" I knew, but I didn't. I was flying all over the country for work, working 12-14 hour days, being brainwashed in the terminals of airports by CNN and MSNBC and then continued that when I got home. I never turned Fox on, even though my niece had been an anchor for Fox outside of Philadelphia. This particular friend challenged me to watch Fox for a week. It was around the time of the Ferguson riots and I got to witness first hand the difference in reporting. As well as the division in our country that our President at the time, Obama, and his side kick Holder, were creating. Not to mention the direct outright attacks on our policemen and women. I was mortified. I thought, who is even going to want to JOIN the force after this? Then what happens to the safety and law and order in this country? It was then that I publicly apologized to everyone on my Facebook page and in person for voting that guy in. I was embarrassed I had not taken an active part in my country and our politics. At the time, my husband and I were both self employed and I thought, hey, let's see about this Affordable Care Act. My first quote was $1,500.00 for two adults and the hospital that was 45 minutes away wasn't on the plan, the one 3 hours away was. My second quote last year was $1,700.00 a month for two adults. No children. No surgeries, never been under anesthesia. Because we make decent salaries, I realized we are now supposed to pay for the people in the county that want to rent houses and ski the mountain and bar-tend when there are no powder days. To the tune of someone telling me they pay $50.00 a month and everything is covered. Me? I had another mortgage payment in the form of the lowest coverage health insurance and oh, if you don't pay it, you get fined. On top of that I had to pay $3,500 in physical therapy from a dogsledding accident I had - the girl paying $50.00 a month on Obamacare? Her therapy was all covered. Approaching 50 years old, I decided I would give up my business last year and work for a company directly. Both for the team interaction as well as it would provide me and my husband healthcare without the nightmare of the ACA. What a shame this is how the Affordable Care Act worked out. As a result, I decided to learn everything and anything I could about politics and I witnessed the complete breakdown of the left when Trump won office. I saw the hate, the lunatic fringe mentality and I saw even more division I had ever seen in my life. I paid attention to the corruption in the Clintons, the Obamas and the FBI. I lost friends on Facebook and in real life {LOL} when I started posting my political views and discussing my right to bear arms, own an AR15 and wear a right to bear arms dog tag with a .22 bullet around my neck. I hang the American flag everyday and a Don't Tread on Me Gadsden flag. I am proud to call this country my home. Proud that my family fought in our wars. I have been to every state in this country and there are good decent people all over. We need to stand up to this hate and get people to unite and to love one another again, regardless of their backgrounds or political stances. This movement is doing just that and I am proud to be a part of it. Lastly, I am saddened that this country forgets itself. My hometown in Massachusetts had men marching from our center town commons to the North Bridge in Concord {not too far away} to start the Revolutionary War after Gage sent his men to take our munitions in that barn...today, there are kids on those town center lawns protesting guns, with their parents along side them. Old Ironsides, The Old North Bridge - this is where our field trips were as kids. We pledged the flag in school in the mornings. Today? #@$%$ the NRA signs held by 8 year olds and worse signs held by young women alongside their moms in protests to our country. To this day, when I see another #$@%$ the NRA post by someone, I pay for another friends membership for one year. I urge people to do the same when and if they can. I walked away. I urge people to RUN away from the hate and start spreading love and unity and common sense. Let's not have our forefathers continue to spin in their collective graves.

I'm tired of regressive leftists and entrenched republicans. What is more likely? That half the population's citizens are Nazis and racists, or support Nazis and racists and that Trump is playing a deep game that involves working with Russians to gain the presidency, or that establishment politicians are afraid of losing power and have been working with the mainstream media to frame Donald Trump while casting anyone that walks away (or that has never walked with them in the first place) as villains? We saw much the same when the Tea Party rose in opposition to establishment republicans and democrats and they were treated the same way. The establishment hates Trump and they hate those of us who support him, love America and recognize its exceptionalism- the likes of which the world had never previously seen; and they hate anyone that doesn't agree to be ""different"" like they are.

We both grew up in very poor households (I lived with my father- a disabled vet- who earned less than $800 in disability monthly and my wife lived with her disabled mother who received less than $700 monthly). Both of our parents were democrats. Neither me nor my wife demanded anything from anyone. We have always believed that you get what you earn and earn what you get. We paid our way through school, and built the life we have.

I have friends who are Democrats, Libertarians, Socialists, Republicans, atheists and Christian. I am a Christian and a Republican. I haven’t always been.

Just because we don’t agree doesn’t mean we can’t hear each other, discuss our differences, and consider each other’s view points!!

But one cannot create balance in the world if the path they walk is uneven, so we must decide if we are really willing to die for what we believe in. But not every belief is true. And pointing the finger at others leaves 3 pointed back at you. I know because I lived a life of self-inflicted strife while convincing myself that I was alright. My downfall was being open-minded. I was striving for acceptance, losing myself to find it. All it left me was blinded to truth, leaving it open for others to define it.

May we speak from our minds and not imitate the lines we are force-fed from the TV screens, and let us love one another, whether they be our foe or our brother.

It was a big deal. I was told every day of my life that I was gonna get judged cuz I was Black. Cops would harass me cuz I was Black...we all know the drill.

She asked me if I thought every other race walked around with this ""everybody judging me cuz of my race"" chip? She said she never thought about being Cherokee or looking White. Never thought about that before. I just bought into the whole identity politics B-line.

I’m a proud gay American sailor serving our country. My mother is a immigrant. I’m half white. I grew up with my parents voting democrat. I’m assuming promises and free handouts?

I’ve lost friends over my support for Trump and at this point I don’t care. My friends on the right never attack me for who I am or what I support.

I see this movement as the beginning of a New America, breaking free from the shackles of incivility, hatred, fear mongering, identity politics, discrimination and reversing the march towards socialism and the NWO! My heartfelt Thank You to Brandon and all the Patriots! As a teenager, I shook hands with JFK at the American Embassy in Rome, where my father was assigned in the Army Attache. JFK was my idol. A few months later he was assassinated. It shook me to my core. Then Robert Kennedy & Martin Luther King were assassinated. A dark time for America. Having lived most of my childhood overseas, Africa, Teheran, Rome, New Delhi, I pretty much ignored politics in my younger years and went on with my life taking care of others as a Respiratory Therapist. At age 21 I fell in love with a woman, and remained in the closet for many years due to far right discrimination. Never got involved with gay rights movement though many of my friends did, applaud them for that, and many are far left feminists. To this day I am to a degree semi-closeted, and now a VERY closeted Trump supporter. No fun. Voted for Democrats most of my adult life, even supported Hillary in the 2008 primary over Obama. My #walkaway moment came when I could not vote for Obama because he boldly claimed he would take $167 B out of Medicare Advantage to pay for Obamacare. I am very protective of my senior clients. A gay friend called me a racist. Excuse me? I have spent my entire career taking care of patients of all stripes and you call me a racist. This is wrong. As Obama continued his term with lofty oration, I saw our country was on a path to 3rd world status, escalating the borrowed money from China to pay our debt. I knew Obamacare would fail. Went to the halls of Congress with a 3 page letter to combat the ACA bill. Went to a Tea Party rally in DC. It was huge...2 million according to police on streets, MSM immensely underestimated numbers. Hard for me to vote Republican in 2012...but I did it. Our country was being given away, piece by piece. Then there was Fast & Furious, Benghazi, Iran deal behind our backs, ISIS, letting Crimea be overtaken and I studied up on the housing bubble burst which affected so many. Found out the idea that ""everyone should own a home"" started with the Communty Reinvestment Act of 1977 with Carter, changes made under Clinton and carried out through the Bush years. Even if you had bad credit you could get a loan. Banks were encouraged to make subprime loans. Greed set in and Wall Street bundled these loans and bet that the whole thing would fail. It did and the politicians on both sides knew it, did nothing to stop it, and had to bail out the banks at our expense. What a sham of a government. Time to wake up! Down the escalator comes Trump. Hmmm, pretty brash...but as the campaign progressed, he seemed to have some common sense ideas on how to fix our problems and bring our jobs back. MSM all over him. I still watched CNN then along with FOX. I voted for Rubio in primary, but had come around to giving Trump a chance by election day. I was shocked he won with all the negative press. But secretly I was thrilled. No way I could share this with my gay friends. Sad. So we all know what Trump has accomplished in regard to our economy in his short term in office despite the constant MSM bashing. I have come to love what he is doing for us, ALL of us. He loves our country as I do. He didn't have to give up his cushy NY condo for the WH. He could be retired, playing golf everyday. But instead he is working tirelessly and fearlessly to right the ship of our Nation, to restore it's economic viability, to weed out the Deep State made up of D's and R's, which looks out for it's own interests at the expense of the citizenry. He respects our Constitution and he talks to us daily through his constant tweets. Hated them at first. But now see it really is the best way for him to communicate with us. On the day the NK agreement was signed I posted on FB that it was a good day for the prospect of peace and hoped the process held. Yikes, I get this barrage of Trump hating responses. Had to take the post down. There is much more to come. Many are going through an Awakening process. Trump is the leader of the #GreatAwakening exposing a failed immigration policy, human trafficking, pedo rings, MS13, drug addiction, unbalanced trade, biased media, depleted military assets, horrendous treatment of our veterans.

My generation has an incredible disdain for the government and the systems in place that govern society. When I was in high school, we hated America. We hated our public school system, our teachers, the failed concept of marriage and what it means to be a family... and we mentally checked out from all of it and decided it wasn't who we were. We remember 9/11, we remember the influx of fear and airport security and a growing prejudice against Muslims and Hispanics from the daily news and the way our parents spoke about it all. Take that, and the growing fear from the destruction of our ecosystem, and we found solace in rebellion and opted out for finger painting with our hippie friends while listening to Rage Against the Machine. We prayed for a zombie apocalypse so that we wouldn't have to endure living in this world for the rest of our lives. So then Obama came, and he was our political rock star. His campaign was all about HOPE, and he made us feel like something different than whatever the hell this is was actually feasible. Did he deliver? No, and looking back, I think his inability to achieve very much was symbolic of a hard lesson that needs to be learned. But I will always be fond of him and grateful for the symbolic hope we were given. Now we have Donald Trump, and we all lost our minds. We went from one extreme to the other, and now we were faced with this egotistical blubbering buffoon on television that makes you cringe. He doesn't present himself well, and we as well as everyone else ran with that out of fear of the safety of humanity and the power of love. Ever since the presidential campaign began, our entire nation has been spoon fed fear, hate, disgust, and a complete intolerance without consideration. To consider what Trump has to offer this country became an unspeakable act of ignorance and racism, and I believed this as deeply as the next Liberal millennial. Then North Korea and the child separations at the border happened, and I quickly identified the blatant ignorance and lack of education behind our hateful intolerance of the ''evils'' of the world. Once this clicked for me, I spent hours of research and was brave enough to admit what I never thought possible: Trump is probably the best president we have ever had, we have all been brainwashed, and my ''political tribe'' holds hatred to a higher regard than critical thinking and problem solving. Since this change in my worldview, I have experienced what other Trump supporters have had to endure. My friends and family were appalled and refused to consider all of the details, my mother even burst into tears when we discussed the children at the border and it shattered my heart to see her so distraught with a poor understanding of the complexities of things. Since then, I have learned to not tell anyone my political views. Not out of fear, but because I just don't have the mental energy to waste on people that want to be angry, reject solutions, and deny their own right to think for their selves. I'm a college student now and have ditched the angry hippie crowd from my past. I'm majoring in psychology with a minor and sociology because I intend to help lift the barrier between the hopeless and the hopeful, to teach other misfits like myself that curiosity and education will set you on a path towards everything that you think you aren't good enough to be a part of. And I am delighted to be doing this in a time when we have a president that will lay the foundations for a society that can make my dreams and others realistically obtainable. Obama gave me hope, but Trump gives me the reassurance that my personal endeavors will not be in vain as the resources will be provided to the ones that seek to repair this mess; ''You'll find the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right'' - The Grateful Dead.","1,474 views",0,1,23Melody's #WalkAway,"I’m an artist and musician from Orlando who grew up democrat, and only ever really knew other liberals in my social circles. Bought into the propaganda, without much of a thought, that republicans/conservative were strictly for big business/the rich and that they had an ignorant prejudice against anyone, anything, and anybody that wasn’t status quo. Voted for Gore, Kerry and Obama both terms. The second term of Obama I noticed the media starting to cover certain things up, and straight out lie about others. That was the first red flag about the Democratic Party for me, but still saw them as the lesser of two evils. THEN the whole social justice/identity politics stuff started up. I saw outlandish and hateful all-or-nothing concepts being presented, spiteful rhetoric, extreme divisiveness, stifling of free speech. Just everyone putting themselves into these terrible little compartments that supposedly dictated their entire experience in life, and of course plenty of purity spiral in fighting. None of this was empowering to anyone—only divisive and hateful. Then I saw the party line flip on pretty KEY issues that I just couldn’t believe. People were starting to apologize for and support globalization, TPP, NAFTA, and Monsanto. Add to that all of those extreme SJW ideas were creeping their way into the DNC, and so too was the idea that not all speech is free. Prior to the elections I wasn’t sure I was going to vote at all. Then Pulse happened in Orlando. This was the downtown I grew up hanging out in. I had been there before. I had friends who went there regularly. It was within 20 miles of the house I grew up in. This was just too close to home for me. I really wanted people to wake up, but saw only the same exact msm/liberal response of disarming the public. After that I became a Trump supporter, and of course managed to lose a good 3/4ths of my friends—online friends, music/art networking friends, but worst of all friends I knew in real life for 20+ years that still will not talk to me. Got called all of the obligatory names, harassed, etc. People spread the word around that I was a “nazi” and many collaborators and people I knew for networking blocked me out. Things only got worse when I started criticizing the violence of Antifa. Thanks for creating #WalkAway.

It was basically the dubious history of the Democratic Party which I had no idea about. Anxious to also see DEATH OF A NATION by D'Sousa starting Aug 3. Clinton's criminal acts continued to escalate and I was quickly disengaging myself from all of this. But it was all the VIOLENCE and HATRED by the Left during and after the presidental election that pushed me over the edge. I no longer wanted to be associated with this kind of behavior. Working in New York I understood Trump's lingo and that was precisely his unfiltered street talk that got him elected by middle America. People could understand him and he was for the average blue collar worker, not catering to movie stars, singers and the elites on both coasts like Hillary. She had no problem with taking huge sums of money from Arabic countries that kill gays and hate women. Basically she has no respect for herself. As a gay man we are told we must be Democrat and the same with Black Americans and Hispanics. This is changing. Once you start to think for yourself it is easy to walk away. Admitting you are a Republican is the new ""coming out!"" The reason Democrats are for open borders and illegal immigrants is because then those people feel obligated to vote for them.

No one calls etc etc. Luckily I have found creative inspiration in doing my own music podcast show now and slowly have started to build a new audience. At least that way i can still be the artist that i am inside. For the last two years I have been met with the kind of hatred and feelings of exclusion that i haven't felt since the days of being harassed and attacked for being openly gay in high school. I was always taught and told that gays or minorities in general should always be democrats and that the republicans hate us etc etc. I believed that lie for a long long time. On the positive side since i came out as a conservative independent the people on the right and independents have been nothing but kind, understanding, and encouraging.

I am an Enrolled Agent Tax Professional involved in the field of tax preparation and audit representation. I always voted Democrat because as an immigrant latino and small business owner, I believed being liberal was right for me until President Trump ran for office. I voted for him and fully support him, but it’s all in secrecy (until now). I was concerned that if my liberal clients, friends, and family found out, my relationships would end, and my business would be affected. After the election, I had to calm down several clients who were in the process of becoming naturalized citizens and other immigration procedures who pay taxes, good people and the perfect example of the kind of Immigrants this nation needs, but they are afraid because of the news (fake media and invented panic). I tell my clients to relax and stay calm, that under this administration they will be better off than with any other administration (because the Democratic party doesn’t care about them as everyone has now seen proven true), and to give Trump a chance and just keep doing what they’re doing so well—working, paying taxes, and being role model citizens. The pure fear and panic caused by the left was ridiculous and hard to watch the effect on these people. It’s so sad we can’t have a mature conversation with a liberal because is it’s their way or nothing.

Being as such, I was raised with a backbone, not a wishbone. I was obsessed with politics from a very early age. I was an oddity. I was nearly 16 years old and completely enthralled by The Iran-Contra hearings. As a living, breathing, thinking daughter of a minority father, I was very aligned with the left. My very first vote EVER was for Bill Clinton. I was so excited. As I continued my college education studying political science, I became indoctrinated.

In my adolescent years where I felt sorry for myself, and victimized I am sure I would of voted blue if I could of. I’m from Portland Oregon and it is liberal land. Over the last few years I have watched the liberal city become total alt leftists. It has totally destroyed the city. The liberals passed laws allowing the increasing homeless population (due to a huge heroine epidemic) camp anywhere. What was once a beautiful city is covered in trash, needles, and views of people literally taking shits on the side of the road in broad daylight. I have watched the loose law liberal judges return children repeatedly to incompetent mothers (who could not follow the law to save their lives) and in turn they suffer greatly. We had our freeways constantly shut down due to protestors. My cousin who works downtown was afraid to go to work sometimes, and at times missed out on making money completely due to protests. The protestors would destroy businesses. I watched the kids I grew up with take zero accountability for themselves. Rich kids who had the world handed to them, preaching about the worlds indecencies from their high horses, while never doing anything to make a difference themselves, most of them living off their parents. Portland is a city with a very deep racist history, which I did not know until later on in life. It is no surprise to me that they lean so left as a result after also learning the deep rooted racist history of the Democratic Party, and how they have strategically made promises to minorities all while labeling them victims, and working to keep them dependent instead of empowering them. My husband and I had enough of this ideology, which is one of the many reasons we relocated to the state of Arizona. My husband and I both saw members of our families who insisted on keeping a victim mentality. We both developed a strong work ethic because of it, and refuse to be victims ourselves. While our spoiled friends who had never seen real issues first hand defended government handouts, we knew better. We have both been effected by other people’s use of drugs, alcohol, and desire to be victims. We reject this state of mind and attribute our drive, work ethic, and success to this. A few years ago I would of considered myself somewhere in between still on the political spectrum. However after seeing the hatefulness the left has exhibited since trump has been in office, I have been pushed further and further from being able to remotely relate to the left mentality. Conservatives have become increasingly tolerate, while the left has shown their true colors. Lastly, from the time I was a kid for reasons I didn’t even know I would be teary eyed saying the pledge of allegiance. The older I get the more I realize I am a huge patriot.
